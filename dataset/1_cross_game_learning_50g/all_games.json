Diana and I both pushed back against auto-locking Eve and instead favored a Diana+Bob core, which is a much more cautious good-aligned approach. Between the remaining options, Eve\u2019s insistence on reusing the M2 lineup (including a heavily suspected me) looks more like evil trying to secure a fail while keeping a convenient scapegoat on the team.

Bob\u2019s preference for Alice\u2013Charlie\u2013Bob aligns with that same read.

Diana\u2019s advocacy for a team of Alice, me, and Eve (which would contain zero evils if she were evil with Alice, or would exclude herself entirely if she were evil with Eve) is inconsistent with optimal evil play, making her much more likely to be good. That leaves Alice and Eve as the most plausible evil pair. In that world, the all-good team is Bob, Charlie, and Diana. Bob\u2019s suggested team of himself, me, and Diana is exactly this composition, while both Alice and Eve are pushing hard for teams that include themselves, which aligns with them trying to secure evil presence on the final mission. Therefore, the safest and most consistent team is Bob, Charlie, and Diana.",

The last slot has to come from {Alice, Bob, Charlie}, where exactly one is good and two are evil. Purely from mission outcomes, Alice, Bob, and Charlie are symmetric candidates (each could be the lone good in one consistent pairing of two evils), so I have to lean on the discussion. Both Bob and Charlie are strongly aligned in pushing the \u201cAlice is the common factor\u201d narrative, which is exactly how a Bob\u2013Charlie evil pair would try to frame things if Alice were actually good. Eve, who I view as good, is more wary of Charlie than Alice after the 2\u2011person fail and explicitly prefers including Alice while warning against putting Bob and Charlie together.

Notice that after Mission 3, both Bob and Charlie immediately pushed to bench Alice and keep a Bob/Charlie core in contention, which lines up much more naturally with world (2) than with Alice as the single common evil. The two\u2011person fail of Alice+Charlie can be explained by Charlie being the single evil there just as easily as by Alice, and the Alice+Bob+Diana fail doesn\u2019t implicate Diana specifically over Bob. Given that, the safest construction that breaks the Bob/Charlie axis while still using prior mission info is to lock in Alice and Diana (who were on the mixed 3\u2011person team) and add me as the fresh third.

This means that Charlie and Diana cannot both be evil together. Any team I pick of the form {Alice, X, Y} that includes a pair which can be jointly evil risks a double-evil team; the only pair among {Bob, Charlie, Diana, Eve} that is guaranteed NOT to be double-evil is {Charlie, Diana}. Therefore, {Alice, Charlie, Diana} is the unique team that structurally cannot contain two evil players. While it\u2019s still possible that exactly one of Charlie or Diana is evil, this team strictly minimizes the worst-case risk (no double-evil scenario), which is the best we can do with the available information.",

              "reasoning": "From the mission results we can publicly deduce Bob is good: if Bob were evil, the fail on Mission 3 (team [Charlie, Diana]) would be impossible, since neither Charlie nor Diana could then be evil enough to account for all fails. Mission 2 (Alice, Bob, Eve) had exactly one fail, so with Bob good, it means exactly one of {Alice, Eve} is evil. Mission 3 (Charlie, Diana) had exactly one fail, so exactly one of {Charlie, Diana} is evil. So the two evils are one from {Alice, Eve} and one from {Charlie, Diana}. Looking at the discussion, Charlie behaves inconsistently with a good player: if he were good, knowing he himself is good, he should conclude Diana is the only candidate evil in {Charlie, Diana} and avoid putting her on teams, yet he repeatedly suggests including Diana. That strongly points to Charlie as the evil from that pair, making Diana good. Eve\u2019s push for the exact double-suspect pairing (Eve, Bob, Charlie) conveniently includes both likely evils (herself and Charlie), which fits her as the other evil rather than Alice. That leaves the good team as {Alice, Bob, Diana}, which I\u2019m proposing here.",

To get exactly one fail in each of those while keeping Alice+Charlie consistently clean together, the most coherent good-world is that the two evils are Bob and Eve: one of them on Mission 2 (Eve) and the other on Mission 4 (Bob). This matches the current discussion split, where Bob and Eve are the pair pushing hard for Alice/Charlie/Eve, while Diana\u2019s reasoning aligns with mine in treating {Bob, Eve} as the suspicious set. Picking Alice/Charlie/Diana avoids repeating either failing lineup and forms the only 3-player combination that cleanly fits all mission results with Alice and Charlie as the trusted core and Bob/Eve as the likely two evils.",

Both Alice and Diana are proposing structures that avoid Eve and acknowledge the split evil in {Alice, Charlie} and {Bob, Eve}, which matches the actual constraint from my perspective. To minimize the chance of including the second evil, I lock in myself and the most likely good (Diana) and then choose the player who isn\u2019t being hard-pushed by the known evil, which is Alice over Charlie.

Alice, by contrast, is focused on avoiding immediately recycling the failed Mission 2 leader and is open to me plus someone not Bob, which is a more conservative, good-leaning approach.

The single fail on Mission 2 came from among {Bob, Charlie, Alice}; but with Alice and Diana passing together on M3 and Charlie and Diana passing together on M1, the combination that best explains all three results without stretching is that the fail came from Bob. That makes Bob the first exclusion, and since the remaining evil would then most likely be off the clean pairings (i.e., more consistent with Eve than with the Alice\u2013Charlie\u2013Diana triangle), the safest and most data-backed team is Alice + Charlie + Diana.

Mission 3 (Bob, Charlie) also had exactly 1 fail, so there is exactly one evil in {Bob, Charlie}. With only 2 total evils in the game, that means the evils are one from {Alice, Eve} and one from {Bob, Charlie}. Eve\u2019s discussion logic was suspiciously self-exonerating (asserting \u2018exactly one evil in {Alice, Diana}\u2019 without justification and excluding herself), which makes her more likely to be the evil in {Alice, Eve}, leaving Alice good. Combining that with Charlie\u2019s strong prior from the clean Mission 1 makes Bob the more likely evil in {Bob, Charlie}. Therefore the most consistent all-good team is [Diana, Charlie, Alice], which avoids both likely evils Bob and Eve and does not repeat either of the failing pairs (Diana\u2013Eve from M2 or Bob\u2013Charlie from M3).",

That means Alice and Diana are effectively confirmed good, and we must pick exactly one player from {Charlie, Bob, Eve}. Between those three, Mission 1 with Alice and Charlie was clean, while Mission 2\u2019s double-fail strongly suggests the evil pair is Bob/Eve rather than Charlie plus one of them (two evils both choosing to fail fits much better than a mixed pair both failing in such a high-risk spot). Diana has independently argued for a Bob/Eve pair as well, which aligns with this deduction. Therefore the safest, most logically consistent good-leaning team is Alice, Charlie, and Diana.",

That means any team including me and one from each suspect pair risks at most 2 evils and in some worlds only 1. Between the two contested options\u2014Alice/Bob/Eve vs Bob/Diana/Eve\u2014both are structurally similar in risk, but the discussion makes Diana look worse: both Bob and Diana were pushing hard for Bob/Diana/Eve, which is exactly what aligned evils would want if they are paired. Alice, on the other hand, has consistently advocated avoiding Charlie and Diana and specifically suggested Alice/Bob/Eve before I did, which is more consistent with a good perspective given the overlaps. Including Charlie is both socially unlikely to pass and doesn\u2019t reduce theoretical risk given we know exactly one of {Bob, Charlie} is evil. Therefore, Alice/Bob/Eve is the best-balanced, most likely-to-pass team that avoids the more suspicious Diana while still fitting the mission logic.",

Additionally, both Alice and Bob are pushing hard to keep the Alice\u2013Bob pair intact on the decisive mission, which is exactly what an evil player in that pair would want after two clean results. To reduce the risk of handing the game to a possibly compromised pair, I\u2019m excluding Alice and choosing Bob plus Charlie: Bob has a clean result with Alice on M3 and was already on the M4 fail (meaning if he\u2019s evil, we\u2019re likely doomed no matter what we pick), while Charlie\u2019s only appearance was on M4, where he could be framed by an already-suspicious Alice.
