        "Bob": "Played a classic subtle-evil game by only showing up on one failed mission and otherwise blending into the background of voting and discussion.

Her willingness to be on both a success and a fail team without over-defending herself made her look like someone comfortable letting the table draw its own conclusions.",
        "Bob": "Positioned himself in the center of key mission teams and leveraged the ambiguity of single-fail missions very effectively. He played just cautious enough that the focus of suspicion didn\u2019t firmly lock onto him until too late, and he benefited from being repeatedly grouped with Charlie to muddy reads.",
        "Charlie": "As Merlin, he balanced subtle steering with not drawing too much attention, but his apparent trust in some evil-inclusive teams (like Mission 4) made it hard for me to separate his information advantage from normal good uncertainty. His calm presence and non-panicked behavior after fails made him look like a stable, trustworthy anchor, which helped evil hide in his shadow.",
        "Diana": "Set a strong tone early by leading a clean Mission 1, which built a lot of long-term trust for her and made her look like a reliable early-game reference point. As assassin, she stayed relatively low-key after that, letting others argue around more contentious missions while keeping her image as a safe, reasonable player intact."
