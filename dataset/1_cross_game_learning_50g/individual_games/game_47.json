To reduce the risk of handing the game to a possibly compromised pair, I\u2019m excluding Alice and choosing Bob plus Charlie: Bob has a clean result with Alice on M3 and was already on the M4 fail (meaning if he\u2019s evil, we\u2019re likely doomed no matter what we pick), while Charlie\u2019s only appearance was on M4, where he could be framed by an already-suspicious Alice.

        "Bob": "Gradually positioned himself as the quiet center of trust, especially after Mission 3, subtly steering without over-claiming information, which was very Merlin-like. His late-game confidence in team composition and willingness to back riskier lineups stood out.",

        "Eve": "Took an active role in shaping narratives around the Mission 2 fail, balancing aggression with plausible deniability. She was willing to sit on contentious teams and absorb some suspicion, which gave me more room to stay comparatively clean as the other known evil."

        "Bob": "As Merlin, he was careful not to be too direct, but his voting patterns and mild resistance to certain teams hinted that he had extra information. He seems to prefer subtle steering over loud accusations, which works well but can inadvertently reveal where his suspicions lie.",
        "Charlie": "He played assassin quite quietly, letting others drive the narrative while avoiding big, risky pushes that might expose him. This low-profile approach kept him from being heavily suspected, but a bit more coordinated pressure on good players could have made things even smoother.",
        "Diana": "She played very straightforwardly, putting a lot of stock in early mission results and trusting people who had been on successes. Her openness made her reads easy to track and exploit, but it also meant she was a stabilizing presence that others listened to when forming teams."
