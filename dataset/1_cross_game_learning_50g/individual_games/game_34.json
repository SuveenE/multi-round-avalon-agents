        "Charlie": "Came across as naturally trustworthy and consistent, which made it believable for evil to frame him as suspicious after Mission 2. Didn\u2019t push too aggressively on accusations, which helped him avoid becoming a clear Merlin candidate and likely contributed to the wrong assassination.",
        "Diana": "Played a very steady, low-drama good game and used leadership on Mission 3 to form a clean, successful team, which was a strong signal of her likely goodness. Her calm style and cooperation made her an easy include on later teams without drawing assassin attention.",
        "Eve": "As assassin, read the table well enough to identify Charlie as a strong candidate for Merlin, showing good awareness of who looked \u2018in the know\u2019. Focused on surface team patterns more than subtle voting/positioning cues, which ultimately led to misidentifying me and losing the assassination."

        "Bob": "Took a fairly active role in team formation on Mission 2, which fit a confident table-presence style but ultimately outed him when that mission failed. Seemed comfortable staying in the mix after the fail, relying on ambiguity and shared blame rather than going low-profile.",
        "Diana": "Came across as naturally trustworthy and straightforward, which made her an easy inclusion on multiple successful teams. Her willingness to take a small, tight team on Mission 3 signaled confidence and helped lock in a clean success for good.",
        "Eve": "Started strong by leading a clean Mission 1, which was a clever way to build early-towncred as assassin. In the endgame, her assassination choice on me showed she was reading surface-level trust patterns accurately but miscalibrated how much Alice was deliberately underplaying her influence."
