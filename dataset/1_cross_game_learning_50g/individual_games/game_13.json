      "self_assessment": "I did a decent job of building trust on Missions 2 and 3, which helped confirm that at least some of us on those teams were good. However, I could have pushed harder to question Bob\u2019s inclusion on Mission 4 and to more explicitly protect Charlie near the end, since he turned out to be Merlin. Next time I should be more vocal about consolidating the mission history into a clear narrative before critical team votes.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Started the game under suspicion because her first mission with Eve failed, but she stayed relatively calm and didn\u2019t over-defend herself, which is consistent with her usual good playstyle. She seemed somewhat passive in later team discussions, which made it harder to use her perspective to clear or condemn others.",
        "Bob": "Managed suspicion very well for an assassin by anchoring himself to successful missions (2 and the proposed 4) and not overreacting to blame. He played a flexible, adaptive style, staying just ambiguous enough that putting him on teams always seemed barely justifiable.",
        "Charlie": "As Merlin, he walked a fine line: he nudged teams toward good outcomes on Missions 2 and 3 without making his reads too obvious. However, some of his trust in Bob by Mission 4 may have been interpreted as a soft endorsement, which in hindsight probably helped evil stay credible and later find him for the assassination.",
        "Eve": "Played a low-profile but effective evil game: the early fail with Alice created long-lasting confusion without making her look like the clearly worse pick. She didn\u2019t need to drive the conversation much; instead, she let others argue and used subtle agreement and voting to keep suspicion distributed."

      "self_assessment": "I managed to blend in reasonably well after the early fail on Mission 1, staying off the suspicion radar enough that I could lead the final losing team without being hard-vetoed. However, I could improve by creating more concrete, persuasive logic trails to frame suspicion on others earlier, rather than relying mostly on social ambiguity and letting Merlin (Charlie) stay relatively comfortable.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Alice played cautiously and seemed to base her decisions heavily on early mission results, which made her suspicious of the wrong people after Mission 1 but also somewhat easy to influence through later mission outcomes.",
        "Bob": "Bob (the assassin) played fairly low-key and didn\u2019t draw much attention, which is good for an assassin, but he also didn\u2019t strongly drive the narrative or push hard accusations, relying more on others to shape the table\u2019s logic.",
        "Charlie": "Charlie, as Merlin, was very measured\u2014he clearly had good info, subtly steered teams away from me at key moments, but avoided overcommitting to hard accusations, which kept him alive but ultimately allowed enough ambiguity for evil to secure the win.",
        "Diana": "Diana played very team- and consensus-oriented, often deferring to what seemed like the most reasonable or majority position at the table, which made her appear reliably good but also somewhat manipulable by stronger voices."
