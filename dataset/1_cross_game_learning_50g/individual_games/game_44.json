        "Diana": "Managed to blend in well by taking only one failing mission and not getting overly aggressive, using mission 2\u2019s fail to create lingering doubt without drawing heavy blame to herself.",
        "Eve": "Stayed just under the radar for much of the game, then leveraged the final mission and post-mission discussion to narrow Merlin down effectively, suggesting careful attention to who subtly favored or avoided certain players."

        "Eve": "Stayed relatively under the radar and let others drive the big alignment debates, which is ideal assassin play; was attentive enough to the mission patterns and table talk to correctly zero in on Alice as Merlin in the end."

        "Diana": "Did a good job blending in by taking a mid-level profile\u2014participating enough without drawing excessive suspicion\u2014and timed her fail contribution well so that it wasn\u2019t immediately pinned on her.",

      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Played very assertively and consistently steered teams, which helped her as Merlin but also made her reads more visible and thus easier to pinpoint. Her team selections were often accurate, but she didn\u2019t spread enough doubt onto other players to hide her knowledge.",
        "Bob": "Played cautiously and tended to follow emerging table consensus rather than drive it, which made him appear generically good but not particularly coordinated. His willingness to be on multiple mixed-alignment teams without strongly objecting made him look less like Merlin and more like a standard good role.",
        "Charlie": "Came across as straightforward and somewhat trusting, especially early on, which reduced suspicion on him but also limited his impact on team decisions. His reactions to mission outcomes felt genuine and uncalculated, marking him as a likely vanilla good from midgame onward.",
        "Eve": "Managed the assassin role well by tracking who was pushing or soft-clearing whom, culminating in a correct Merlin shot on Alice. Played subtly enough during the missions to avoid being the center of attention, saving her credibility and focus for the endgame read."
