Eve\u2019s discussion logic was suspiciously self-exonerating (asserting \u2018exactly one evil in {Alice, Diana}\u2019 without justification and excluding herself), which makes her more likely to be the evil in {Alice, Eve}, leaving Alice good.

        "Charlie": "Played cautiously and tried to project a logical, measured image, which fits a Merlin style and made him look trustworthy. He avoided overt accusations, which kept him safe for a long time but also made him a subtle focal point for trust.",
        "Diana": "As a leader twice, she favored including herself and people she tentatively trusted, which showed a preference for stability over experimentation. Once burned by a fail, she still leaned toward familiar picks, suggesting she relies heavily on early impressions.",
        "Eve": "Played in a straightforward, good-leaning manner, with team choices that appeared consistent and not overly paranoid. She didn\u2019t push hard social reads, which made her seem sincere but also made it easier for evil to steer the narrative around her."

I could improve by being more active in shaping team compositions and discussion, as I relied a bit heavily on others (especially Diana and Charlie) to drive table talk, which might not work as well in a tougher lobby.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Played subtly evil, letting others sit in the spotlight while still getting onto critical teams; her presence on the failing Mission 2 team didn\u2019t immediately mark her as suspicious, which suggests she managed her table image well.",
        "Charlie": "Very effective as Merlin, consistently ending up on key teams and influencing lineups without appearing too obvious; their calm presence probably helped good trust them, which made them a high-value assassination target.",
        "Diana": "Assertive and central to the game flow, frequently leading teams and discussion; despite leading two failing missions, she maintained enough social credibility that good never fully turned on her, which is impressive but also a potential future target for suspicion.",
        "Eve": "More cautious and somewhat reactive in table talk, often following the logic laid out by others rather than driving it; being on a failing team as a good player seemed to shake her confidence a bit, making her less forceful later in the game."

Next time, I should more actively shape team compositions earlier and use more nuanced, indirect resistance to bad teams so my information has impact without making it obvious who Merlin is.",

        "Diana": "Consistently tried to build logical teams and seemed genuinely torn by conflicting information, which made her look very authentically good even when her teams were manipulated.",

        "Eve": "Came across as generally good and cooperative, but because her mission with me failed, the resulting suspicion on that team made it harder to correctly clear her in time."

I also didn\u2019t press hard enough on reconciling Mission 2\u2019s fail with Diana\u2019s later team choices, so I didn\u2019t fully challenge the narrative that kept Alice trusted.

        "Bob": "Bob\u2019s assassin play leaned into looking reasonable and cooperative, especially by leading a clean Mission 1 that built a strong trust base. He was willing to take a risky slot on Mission 3, which helped redirect blame and kept suspicion spread out rather than focused.",
        "Charlie": "Charlie, as Merlin, stayed cautious and didn\u2019t over-defend the correct good players, which unfortunately made it harder for us to clearly separate good from evil. His mission-approval pattern was subtle enough that his information edge didn\u2019t fully translate into clear, persuasive pushes on team compositions.",
        "Diana": "Diana played like a very straightforward good player, proposing teams that seemed logical on the surface but ended up repeatedly including Alice, which evil capitalized on. She projected trust and confidence in her reads, which strongly influenced mission team selections even when the underlying logic could have been challenged more."
