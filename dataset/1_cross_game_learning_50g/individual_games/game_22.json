Mission 3 (Charlie, Diana) had exactly one fail, so exactly one of {Charlie, Diana} is evil. So the two evils are one from {Alice, Eve} and one from {Charlie, Diana}. Looking at the discussion, Charlie behaves inconsistently with a good player: if he were good, knowing he himself is good, he should conclude Diana is the only candidate evil in {Charlie, Diana} and avoid putting her on teams, yet he repeatedly suggests including Diana. That strongly points to Charlie as the evil from that pair, making Diana good. Eve\u2019s push for the exact double-suspect pairing (Eve, Bob, Charlie) conveniently includes both likely evils (herself and Charlie), which fits her as the other evil rather than Alice.
