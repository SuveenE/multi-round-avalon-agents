I could improve by managing the mid-game better\u2014Mission 4\u2019s fail suggests I either didn\u2019t push hard enough against that team or wasn\u2019t clear enough in signaling suspicion about its composition.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Played very cleanly and consistently, which made you a natural late-game trust anchor and a believable Merlin candidate. Your calm presence on multiple successful missions helped sell the idea that you had extra information.",
        "Bob": "You balanced aggression and subtlety well as the assassin, creating just enough doubt to get a mission fail without being obviously evil. Your final Merlin guess on Alice showed you were paying attention to table perception, even though you misread my quieter influence.",
        "Diana": "You blended in early by leading a successful first mission but then kept a relatively low profile, which helped avoid direct suspicion. Your contribution to the failed mission was well-timed, though not fully capitalized on as suspicion never concentrated heavily on you.",
        "Eve": "You played like a cautious but generally rational good player, willing to go on risky teams but not overreacting to single fails. Your presence on the final mission, combined with your earlier behavior, made it easier to frame that team as trustworthy without outing me as Merlin."

However, our coordination around when to fail missions and our Merlin read were off\u2014Mission 4\u2019s fail didn\u2019t translate into enough doubt on Charlie, and I misread Alice as Merlin instead of picking up on how subtly central and consistently trusted Charlie was.",

        "Eve": "Played like a straightforward good: took a risky team on Mission 2 that ended up failing, but afterward stayed conservative, aligning more with the emerging consensus and not overasserting reads."

      "self_assessment": "I trusted the wrong person on Mission 2, which put me on a failing team and could have made me look suspicious, so I should be more cautious about early trust and pay closer attention to voting patterns.

        "Alice": "Alice looked very consistently good by being on all three successful missions, which made her a natural target for the assassin. Her playstyle was steady and low-drama, making her seem reliable and non-threatening.",
        "Bob": "Bob played a subtle evil game by failing Mission 2 in a way that kept suspicion spread around, especially toward Alice and potentially me. He didn't over-defend himself, which helped him avoid becoming an obvious suspect until later.",
        "Charlie": "Charlie as Merlin balanced giving information with not over-pushing too hard, especially by repeatedly ending up on successful teams without loudly accusing specific players. Their final leadership on Mission 5 and choice of team showed strong hidden information use while still keeping Merlin identity somewhat ambiguous.",
        "Diana": "Diana\u2019s leadership on Mission 1 resulting in a success helped her appear more trustworthy early on, which is a solid evil tactic. Later being on the failed Mission 4 team added just enough confusion to keep good from fully locking in the team until the end."
