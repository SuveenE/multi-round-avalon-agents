From my seat as known-good, that hard tunnel feels more like misdirection than genuine solving, so I lean Charlie as the good one in that pair.\n\nBetween Diana and Eve, Diana\u2019s suggested core of Alice + Charlie and then choosing between herself and Eve is more consistent with someone trying to reason from the board even at the cost of excluding herself, while Eve\u2019s push for Bob + Charlie + Eve conveniently keeps herself on the critical final team while defending me in a way that can come from either alignment. I slightly prefer Diana as the good in that pair.\n\nPutting that together, the highest-percentage good team from my perspective is me (Bob), Charlie (more likely good over Alice), and Diana (slightly more likely good over Eve).",

I need to be more skeptical of 'helpful' players who always end up on key teams and to track voting patterns more rigorously instead of relying on gut reads.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Very assertive in team selection and managed to be on multiple failing missions without drawing enough suspicion, suggesting strong social manipulation and good timing in pushing her preferred teams.",
        "Charlie": "Played in a relatively straightforward and transparent way, which made them look quite towny but also easier for evil to frame or steer around in later missions.",
        "Diana": "Stayed somewhat in the background early, then leveraged that low profile to get trust for Mission 3 and avoid being heavily suspected as evil, a classic patient-assassin style.",
        "Eve": "Played a very convincing Merlin by acting like a cautious, logic-driven good player without over-pushing any single suspicion, keeping her info-feel subtle enough that I didn\u2019t recognize the role until it was too late."

I should have challenged Alice more aggressively after Mission 2\u2019s fail and been more vocal about why Eve looked increasingly likely to be Merlin instead of just quietly supporting good-looking teams.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Very assertive in proposing teams and used Mission 2\u2019s mixed lineup to muddy reads, then pushed her own narrative convincingly enough to get critical endgame teams approved. She\u2019s good at staying active and framing her aggression as \u2018solving the game,\u2019 which makes it harder to catch her as evil.",
        "Bob": "Played very straightforwardly and consistently, which is good for building a solid good-town image but made him easier to sideline in key decision moments. Tended to follow the momentum of the table rather than force big strategic re-evaluations.",
        "Diana": "Kept a relatively low but steady profile and used that to slip into a successful Mission 3 without drawing suspicion, then capitalized late as assassin. She\u2019s good at not over-speaking and letting others (like Alice) drive the narrative while she gathers information.",
        "Eve": "Very subtly guided team choices and discussions without being too loud, which fit Merlin well and clearly helped identify safe early missions. She balanced appearing reasonable and slightly cautious without screaming \u2018Merlin,\u2019 though in hindsight her accuracy on good teams was a clear clue we didn\u2019t leverage enough."

        "Bob": "Played cautiously and seemed to rely heavily on mission results rather than social reads, which made him slower to hard-clear or hard-accuse others. This made him less threatening to evil but also less influential overall.",
        "Charlie": "Tended to follow emerging table consensus and adjusted opinions as more mission data came in, rather than strongly pushing independent theories. This made his voting patterns feel relatively safe and predictable.",
        "Eve": "Played a subtle Merlin game, not over-pushing on the real evils and trying to spread suspicion, especially by allowing some doubt to remain on good players. Their willingness to go on mixed teams helped maintain their cover but also gave evil room to maneuver on mission composition."

        "Charlie": "Played in a straightforward, transparent way, often aligning with what looked logically consistent, which made him relatively easy to read as good. However, his openness also made him somewhat easy to steer by more vocal players.",
        "Diana": "Showed strong discipline as assassin by passing mission 3 and maintaining a convincingly good image. She balanced occasional agreement with good players and timely support of evil-leaning teams, positioning herself well for both mission impact and the final assassination decision."
