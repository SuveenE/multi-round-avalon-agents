        "Alice": "Played cautiously but leaned toward trusting early success, which made her appear consistently good and a safe anchor for later missions. She seemed to value team stability, reusing known groups rather than aggressively interrogating earlier results.",
        "Bob": "Played in a very low-key, non-accusatory way that kept suspicion off him for most of the game. He tended to follow emerging consensus rather than drive it, which made him blend in as a reliable but not forceful voice.",
        "Charlie": "Blended early success with a later, well-timed fail that generated confusion without drawing too much heat directly onto himself. He used the ambiguity of mixed mission results effectively, pushing doubt onto others instead of defending himself overtly.",
        "Eve": "Took calculated risks, especially on Mission 2, and used that fail to sow long-term doubt without overexplaining. As assassin, she read the table well and correctly picked up on my over-defensiveness and pattern of avoiding her, which led to a successful Merlin guess."

      "self_assessment": "I coordinated well with Charlie by timing the Mission 2 and 3 fails so that good still felt they had reasonable teams, and I used the clean late-game missions to narrow down who was protecting whom. I could improve by seeding more doubt between Alice and Bob earlier, since the final mission pattern made it slightly clearer that Diana\u2019s earlier positioning and commentary were more likely to be Merlin.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Alice gravitated toward stable, low-conflict teams and seemed comfortable reusing similar team compositions once they worked, which gave her a steady but somewhat predictable pattern. She appeared to trust early success strongly, which made her slower to reevaluate after Mission 2 and 3 fails.",
        "Bob": "Bob played cautiously and favored teams that leaned on perceived consensus, especially later in the game when he repeated the Alice\u2013Bob\u2013Diana team after its success. His choices suggested he relied more on table sentiment than on aggressively pushing his own reads.",
        "Charlie": "Charlie balanced subtle sabotage with plausible deniability, especially by taking part in early success and then leading a critical fail mission without drawing overwhelming suspicion. His leadership decisions framed Diana as a \u2018safe\u2019 inclusion for the good team later, indirectly helping our assassination.",
        "Diana": "Diana played a careful Merlin game, nudging team selections away from the worst options without being too obvious, particularly around the missions involving Eve and Charlie. However, her consistent presence on the successful late-game teams and her relatively accurate instincts on earlier team discussions ultimately made her stand out enough to be correctly identified as Merlin."
