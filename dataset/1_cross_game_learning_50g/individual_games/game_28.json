        "Alice": "She blended in well by accepting early team proposals and only revealing her evil role gradually through key fails, especially on my Mission 2, which suggests she\u2019s comfortable leveraging trust built from others\u2019 credibility.",
        "Bob": "Bob tended to rely on previous mission information and went back to familiar configurations (like reusing himself and me), indicating a preference for pattern-based reasoning and trusting players who have already been on successes.",
        "Charlie": "As Merlin, Charlie played cautiously, not aggressively steering team selections, which kept him safe but also allowed evil to stay on critical missions without being strongly challenged.",
        "Eve": "Eve stayed off some early critical teams and then joined a small team for Mission 3 to deliver a precise fail, suggesting a patient, opportunistic style that looks for low-noise situations to act decisively."

      "self_assessment": "I stayed well-hidden as evil, letting Alice take the risky early fail while I delivered a clean, low-suspicion fail on Mission 3 that pushed the game toward an evil victory. I could improve by more actively shaping good\u2019s narratives about who was trustworthy, especially steering more heat toward Diana and away from Charlie to make the endgame assassination choice even clearer and safer.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Willing to take early risks for evil, using the Mission 2 fail in a larger team to muddy reads and create durable ambiguity about where the fail came from.",
        "Bob": "Tended to trust his own team choices once they worked, reusing himself frequently and anchoring on early impressions instead of fully reevaluating after later fails.",
        "Charlie": "Played a relatively quiet but accurate information game as Merlin, guiding team selections subtly enough to avoid obvious hard clears but still nudging toward good-heavy teams.",
        "Diana": "Showed a generally cooperative and straightforward playstyle, which made her seem reliably good but also a convenient scapegoat when fails appeared on teams she was on."
