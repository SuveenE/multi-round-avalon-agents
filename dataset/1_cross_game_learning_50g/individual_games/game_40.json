That means any team including me and one from each suspect pair risks at most 2 evils and in some worlds only 1. Between the two contested options\u2014Alice/Bob/Eve vs Bob/Diana/Eve\u2014both are structurally similar in risk, but the discussion makes Diana look worse: both Bob and Diana were pushing hard for Bob/Diana/Eve, which is exactly what aligned evils would want if they are paired. Alice, on the other hand, has consistently advocated avoiding Charlie and Diana and specifically suggested Alice/Bob/Eve before I did, which is more consistent with a good perspective given the overlaps. Including Charlie is both socially unlikely to pass and doesn\u2019t reduce theoretical risk given we know exactly one of {Bob, Charlie} is evil.

I could improve by being more vocal about my reads on Charlie and Diana earlier, as I was a bit too reactive and could have pushed harder on the logic behind the Mission 2 and 3 fails.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Played a very controlled, low-drama Merlin game: took some risk trusting me early on Mission 1, then subtly steered back to the same good core late without drawing too much assassin attention. Her consistency on team preferences made her look generically good rather than obviously Merlin.",
        "Charlie": "Slotted comfortably into mid-game teams and managed to get a fail on Mission 2 without appearing overly suspicious at first. Tended to hide behind group consensus rather than drive team proposals, which helped him avoid being the focal point of blame.",
        "Diana": "As assassin, she mixed aggression with restraint: got a fail through on Mission 3 but didn\u2019t over-talk, which kept her somewhat ambiguous. The final assassination on me shows she was actively tracking good\u2019s trust patterns but slightly over-weighted my apparent influence over Alice\u2019s.",
        "Eve": "Played like a straightforward good: her decisions lined up with successful teams by the end, and she didn\u2019t overcomplicate her table talk. Her willingness to rejoin the same team for Missions 4 and 5 helped solidify trust and close the game cleanly."

She let others push harder arguments, which masked her information advantage well.",
        "Bob": "He looked like a cautious but ordinary good player, occasionally doubting teams without strongly driving the table, which made him seem like a plausible Merlin decoy. His willingness to be on multiple key missions without over-defending himself contributed to my mistaken read.",
        "Charlie": "He played evil subtly by failing only when it really mattered and otherwise keeping a pretty neutral table presence. His mission 3 play put heat elsewhere effectively, helping shift suspicion without making himself look too orchestrating.",
        "Eve": "She played straightforwardly and leaned on logical, surface-level reasoning, which made her look very towny but not especially informed. Her participation on the last two successful teams without over-claiming credit helped her blend in as solid but non-special good."

        "Bob": "Came across as reliably good, especially after being on both the first clean mission and the later successful teams, which helped anchor trust for the final missions. His presence on the final team and being chosen by Merlin for multiple missions suggests his table image was solid and non-threatening.",
        "Charlie": "Managed to get a fail on Mission 3 with a compact two-person team, which indicates effective early-game trust-building or leveraging confusion after Mission 2. However, their position became more exposed later as they were excluded from the stable, successful teams on Missions 4 and 5.",
        "Diana": "As assassin, she successfully got a fail on Mission 2, which shows decent early infiltration and positioning among good players. In the end, her assassination on Bob instead of Alice suggests she misread Merlin\u2019s level of influence or overestimated how suspicious Alice appeared, indicating room to refine late-game read accuracy."
