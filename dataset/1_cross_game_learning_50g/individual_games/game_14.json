        "Alice": "Tended to trust early mission success as a strong signal and leaned into simple narratives (e.g., \u2018Mission 1 worked, so that pair is likely good\u2019), which made her predictable but also reliably cooperative once she felt safe with someone.",
        "Charlie": "Played a subtle evil game by failing only one mission and then staying quiet enough afterward to avoid drawing too much heat, relying on others to over-explain or over-defend instead of actively steering discussion.",
        "Diana": "Showed a preference for conservative, previously successful team compositions and seemed strongly influenced by past success, which made her a stabilizing force for good but also somewhat exploitable by evil if they ever got onto a successful team.",
        "Eve": "Assassin play was observant and patient; she keyed in on confidence levels and who seemed to have \u2018extra\u2019 information, ultimately making a precise Merlin guess rather than getting baited by louder or more chaotic players."

I could improve by sowing more deliberate doubt about Diana and Alice earlier, as I allowed too clean of a pattern of trust to form around them that might have backfired if the assassin read Merlin less precisely.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Tended to trust stable, low-conflict teams and was willing to reuse previously successful team configurations, which made her appear consistently good but also somewhat predictable. She didn\u2019t push aggressively on logic after the Mission 2 fail, preferring social reads and \u2018felt-safe\u2019 combos instead.",
        "Bob": "Played a very controlled Merlin game, guiding team choices through subtle agreement and reinforcement rather than overt logical dominance. He managed to avoid being loudly accusatory, but the pattern of him landing on mostly clean teams and surviving the failed mission made him just suspicious enough for a sharp assassin to catch.",
        "Diana": "Acted as a stabilizer, often favoring continuity and low-drama proposals, which helped create an overall trusted table environment. She seemed more reactive than proactive in deduction, weighing others\u2019 arguments more than pushing her own strong theories.",
        "Eve": "Showed good patience as Assassin, letting information from mission results and social consensus build before locking in on Merlin. Her read on Bob indicated she was tracking who consistently ended up on successful teams and who subtly steered discussions, not just who talked the most."

        "Alice": "Played very cleanly with no obvious red flags, and her inclusion on multiple successful teams helped her look reliably good. She seemed a bit cautious in pushing hard accusations, which kept her trusted but also meant evil had more room to maneuver.",
        "Bob": "His team picks and voting patterns were very accurate, which in hindsight clearly reflected Merlin-level information. He tried to stay subtle, but his consistent presence on good teams and confidence in certain players made him stand out enough for the assassin to correctly target him.",
        "Charlie": "Slipped the single fail onto Mission 2 in a way that didn\u2019t draw much heat, blending into the confusion well. He kept a relatively low profile afterward, neither over-defending nor over-accusing, which helped him avoid becoming the focal suspect.",
        "Eve": "Tracked the information flow well and read the table accurately enough to land the correct Merlin shot on Bob. She seemed especially attentive to who was quietly but consistently right about teams, which is exactly what you want from an assassin in the late game."

        "Charlie": "Did a good job blending in as evil by allowing some successful missions and not overreacting after the failed Mission 2. Their low-key style helped avoid being framed as the obvious source of the fail, which protected overall evil credibility.",
