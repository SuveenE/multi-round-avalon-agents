        "Diana": "Seemed flexible and cooperative in team building, which helped her appear reliably good despite being on multiple key missions. Her leadership on the successful Mission 3 restored trust after earlier suspicion points.",
        "Eve": "Timed the fail on Mission 4 in a way that kept some ambiguity alive, but the follow-up narrative didn\u2019t successfully shift blame onto Merlin candidates. The final assassination choice on Charlie showed she was leaning too heavily on mission patterns without fully accounting for Alice\u2019s quiet influence."

      "self_assessment": "I helped keep suspicion spread out by being willing to go on multiple critical teams, even after a fail, which made it harder for evil to lock onto Merlin and let good still form successful missions later. However, I could have been more assertive in publicly questioning Bob and Eve after the failed missions instead of staying relatively neutral, which might have accelerated consensus on a more reliable core team.",

        "Alice": "Played subtly but consistently pro-good, managing to get on multiple key teams without drawing lethal suspicion, especially after leading the final successful mission; her calm participation style fit Merlin well and clearly misdirected the assassin. She seemed to balance giving guidance with not over-pushing her reads, which helped her survive the assassination.",
        "Bob": "Was positioned suspiciously after Mission 2\u2019s fail on a three-player team, but managed not to become the sole scapegoat, suggesting a careful, low-key evil style. He avoided loud leadership and instead blended into the middle of the pack, which let him survive socially even as evidence mounted.",
        "Diana": "Came across as a trusted anchor after appearing on two clean missions (1 and 3), which helped form a credible good core later in the game. She seemed comfortable taking responsibility as leader and as a frequent team member, and her consistency made it easier for good to lock in a safe final team.",
        "Eve": "As assassin, she played cautiously enough that she wasn\u2019t immediately written off as evil even after leading a failed Mission 4, indicating a willingness to take a risky leadership role while still trying to appear reasonable. Her final assassination on me instead of Alice showed she bought into the narrative that I might be Merlin, so she was somewhat successfully misdirected by good\u2019s table dynamics."

      "self_assessment": "I stayed consistently pro-team-good by choosing safe lineups once I had some mission info, especially on Missions 1 and 3, which helped build trust around me. I could improve by being more vocal in pushing alternative narratives about who Merlin might be, since I largely let that develop on its own and didn\u2019t actively help misdirect the assassin.",

        "Alice": "Played a very controlled Merlin game\u2014gave just enough resistance and guidance through team votes and subtle reactions without over-signaling, which paid off when the assassin misfired. She also handled the pressure of being on multiple critical missions while still looking plausibly non-Merlin.",
        "Bob": "Took an active early role by leading Mission 1 in a way that didn\u2019t immediately out him as evil, which helped him build early credibility. However, his presence on the failed Mission 2 seeded long-term suspicion that he struggled to fully shake.",
        "Charlie": "Came across as genuinely conflicted and transparent, which read as strongly good-aligned, especially after being on both a failed and a successful mission with mixed company. His voting and mission behavior made him a believable Merlin candidate, which ultimately drew the assassin\u2019s shot away from the real Merlin.",
        "Eve": "Played a relatively low-key assassin game, blending in well enough to avoid being the center of suspicion, especially around Mission 4\u2019s fail. In the endgame, though, her Merlin read focused too heavily on Charlie\u2019s openness and mission history, causing her to overlook Alice\u2019s more subtle but consistent guiding behavior."

I should have paid closer attention to how Alice subtly steered teams without over-insisting, and cross-checked that with who consistently avoided pairing too many confirmed-goods rather than just focusing on who touched both fails.",

        "Alice": "Played a very controlled Merlin game: willing to be on risky teams early (M2) but later pushed herself onto the final successful team in a way that felt \u2018reasonable\u2019 instead of desperate, which disguised her info advantage well.",
        "Bob": "As evil on M2, managed to get a clean single fail that didn\u2019t over-expose them, then stayed relatively quiet afterward, letting suspicion drift toward Charlie rather than trying to drive the narrative too hard.",
        "Charlie": "Looked suspicious mainly due to being on both failed missions, but their behavior was otherwise fairly natural and not overly defensive, which in hindsight was a good indicator they were not Merlin despite being a tempting assassination target.",
        "Diana": "Took solid, safe team choices (especially on M1 and M3) and projected a consistent \u2018cautious good\u2019 vibe; even after being on the failed M4 team, they maintained trust well enough to be included on the final mission."
