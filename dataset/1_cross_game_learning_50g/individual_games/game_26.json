        "Alice": "You played very straightforwardly and were consistently willing to go on teams, which fit a typical good pattern and made it tough to doubt you after Mission 1 and 2 compositions. The downside was that your association with both me and later Bob/Eve created some confusing mixed signals that evil could exploit.",
        "Bob": "You were subtly persuasive and kept yourself in the mix for key teams without coming off as overly controlling, which is strong assassin play. Your Mission 3 leadership was particularly effective because it looked like a reasonable attempt to \u2018reset\u2019 after a fail, masking your alignment well.",
        "Charlie": "You did a good job as Merlin by not being too obvious early, especially around Mission 1, while still nudging suspicions in generally correct directions. Later, some of your accurate pushes on Bob/Eve probably made you stand out just enough for the assassin, so balancing that info leakage will be key next time.",
        "Eve": "You blended in well on discussion and used the fact that your failed Mission 2 team included two previously \u2018trustworthy\u2019 players (me and Alice) to muddy the waters. Your willingness to sit on a partially cleared image after that fail helped keep suspicion spread out instead of focused on you and Bob."
