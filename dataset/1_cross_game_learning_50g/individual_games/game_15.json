The last slot has to come from {Alice, Bob, Charlie}, where exactly one is good and two are evil.

Both Bob and Charlie are strongly aligned in pushing the \u201cAlice is the common factor\u201d narrative, which is exactly how a Bob\u2013Charlie evil pair would try to frame things if Alice were actually good. Eve, who I view as good, is more wary of Charlie than Alice after the 2\u2011person fail and explicitly prefers including Alice while warning against putting Bob and Charlie together.
