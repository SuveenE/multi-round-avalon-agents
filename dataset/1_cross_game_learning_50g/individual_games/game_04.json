        "Bob": "Tends to play straightforward and somewhat trusting, which is good for table harmony but can leave him vulnerable to being steered by confident evil players. When suspicious, he hesitates to push very hard, so his doubts don\u2019t always translate into strong votes or persuasive table talk.",
        "Charlie": "Approaches the game analytically and tries to justify decisions with clear reasoning, which is very helpful for good when he\u2019s on the right track. However, he can get anchored on early assumptions, making it easier for evil to exploit his initial reads if they\u2019re even slightly off.",
        "Eve": "As assassin, she stayed socially central but not overly loud, which helped her gather information about who might be Merlin without drawing suspicion. She was willing to take leadership spots and put together subtly compromised teams, and her kill choice showed she paid careful attention to who was nudging votes and team choices just a bit more than others."

      "self_assessment": "I stayed convincingly flexible between missions, leading two teams without drawing heavy suspicion and helping coordinate just enough fails to win without overexposing evil. I could improve by more explicitly steering suspicion toward a single, consistent \u2018fake Merlin\u2019 target earlier so that the endgame assassin shot would have been more cleanly justified rather than somewhat shared across multiple suspects.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Played a low-key but effective evil game, blending into good logic and slipping a fail on Mission 2 without becoming the primary suspect, which helped keep attention spread out. Tended to follow group consensus rather than drive it, which made her look more like a cautious good player than a central evil force.",
        "Bob": "Came across as genuinely good and somewhat straightforward, often trusting mission compositions a bit more than a paranoid player would, which made him less likely to be seen as evil but also less influential on team-building. His voting and table talk felt consistent, which made him a relatively safe person to include on teams once others attracted suspicion.",
        "Charlie": "Showed a more analytical tendency, especially around missions 2 and 3, trying to reason from fail patterns and team overlaps, though not always pushing those conclusions forcefully. Occasionally second-guessed himself, which reduced his impact on steering the table but also kept him from being easily read as either strongly good or strongly evil.",
        "Diana": "Subtly guided team selections and reads without over-asserting, which is very Merlin-like\u2014she nudged away from some dangerous configurations but did it in a way that looked like normal deduction. Her comments were usually well-timed and grounded in mission data, making her seem like a strong, observant good player rather than a loud leader, which was a key indicator of hidden information."
