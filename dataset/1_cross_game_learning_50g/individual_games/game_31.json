Charlie\u2019s logic is very structurally sound but more cautious and late in explicitly pinning us, and Diana mostly follows the structural clears without that same \u201cI *know* it\u2019s Bob+Eve\u201d energy, so they both feel more like well\u2011reasoned Resistance than someone sitting on extra info.",

You seemed willing to eat suspicion if it meant muddying Merlin reads and forcing good to second-guess clean players.",
        "Charlie": "You came across as steady and trustworthy, especially from Mission 3 onward when your clean team with Diana built a strong good core. Your choices suggested you were carefully tracking who caused fails and preferred smaller, controlled teams to minimize risk.",
        "Diana": "You balanced information and subtlety well for Merlin, avoiding obvious overcorrections while still gravitating toward strong good teams on Missions 3 and 5. Your low-key guidance and willingness to partner repeatedly with Charlie without loudly condemning others helped you stay just under the assassin\u2019s radar.",
        "Eve": "As assassin, you blended in decently at first, but the decision to join Bob on the failing Mission 2 created a clear link that later worked against you. Your eventual Mission 4 team, which included Bob and led to another fail, reinforced the perception that you were coordinating with the same circle, making the Merlin read trickier but the evil cluster more visible."

        "Alice": "Played conservatively and built trust through clean missions, especially Mission 1, which made her a natural late-game \u2018safe\u2019 leader and an easy mis-assassination target. She seems comfortable repeatedly trusting the same small core once it works, which can be exploited or framed in future games.",
        "Charlie": "Quiet but mechanically consistent, taking a clean Mission 3 that boosted their credibility without looking flashy. Charlie seems to prefer low-profile, solid logic over aggressive table talk, which can make them a stable anchor for good teams and harder to push heavy suspicion onto without concrete evidence.",
        "Diana": "Very subtle Merlin: she consistently backed good teams (Missions 3, 4, and 5) while not over-arguing reads, which kept her from standing out as the obvious information role. She\u2019s good at nudging outcomes rather than dictating them, which makes her a high-priority player to track in future games when clean team suggestions line up a bit too well.",
        "Eve": "Aggressive evil partner who helped create strong chaos early with the double-fail Mission 2, but then overfocused on Alice in the assassination, missing Diana\u2019s cautious but accurate guidance. Eve seems comfortable taking visible risks and playing loudly, which is great for sowing doubt but needs tighter alignment with endgame assassination logic."

        "Eve": "Took a bold evil line by joining the risky three-person Mission 2 and contributing to the double fail, which created a lot of confusion early. Later, as leader on Mission 4, she positioned another failing team while still keeping enough ambiguity that the final assassination guess went wrong."

The final Merlin guess on Alice indicates she read vocal influence and leadership as Merlin tells, rather than tracking who was quietly but consistently right."
