Both failed missions necessarily involve at least one of Alice or Bob as evil in most consistent worlds: Mission 3\u2019s fail requires either Alice or Charlie to be bad, and Mission 4\u2019s fail requires either Charlie or Bob to be bad. The simplest and safest construction is that the evil pair is among {Alice, Bob, maybe one of the Mission\u20114 overlaps}, so excluding both Alice and Bob simultaneously and returning to the only fully successful 3\u2011player team (Charlie, Diana, Eve) minimizes the chance of accidentally including an evil while maximizing reliance on known clean history.",
