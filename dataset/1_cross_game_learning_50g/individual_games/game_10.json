        "Charlie": "Charlie balanced information use very well as Merlin, nudging mission choices toward all-good teams without over-asserting or making themselves an obvious target. Their calm, consistent support of the correct teams made the game feel smooth and low-conflict from a good perspective.",
        "Diana": "Diana played like a straightforward, cooperative good player: agreeable on solid team proposals and not forcing unnecessary debates. Their lack of dramatic swings in opinion helped keep the table calm and probably made it easier for Merlin to guide the game quietly.",

Their subtlety kept them from being loudly suspected, but it also meant evil had little leverage to derail team selection or sow serious doubt."

His subtle guidance in team compositions was more telling in hindsight than it appeared during play.",
        "Diana": "Diana\u2019s leadership on Mission 3 was cautious but not overly defensive, which made her seem like an ordinary good player rather than a power role. She followed emerging consensus more than she drove it, which helped mask Charlie\u2019s influence.",

        "Charlie": "As Merlin, he did an excellent job guiding team selections towards all-good lineups without ever looking too loud or controlling. His restraint and subtle nudging clearly paid off, since evil never sabotaged a mission and still mis-guessed him at the end.",
        "Eve": "Had to sit through three straight clean missions, which is a rough position for evil, and managed not to panic or overreact publicly. Her low profile kept her from being the obvious suspect, though that same quietness limited evil\u2019s ability to disrupt team formation."
