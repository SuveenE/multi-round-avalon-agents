I could improve by shaping the table talk more proactively, especially pushing stronger alternative narratives about who was evil to lock in more confusion earlier.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "You played as a consistently trusted, default pick for teams, which suggests a straightforward, cooperative style that made you look very village-core. You didn\u2019t push many hard accusations, which kept you safe but also made it easier for evil to steer the narrative around you.",
        "Bob": "You ended up on two failing missions as a good player, which made you look more suspicious than you actually were; you seemed somewhat reactive rather than driving the discussion. Tightening your reasoning in public discussions and more strongly defending or accusing could help shift suspicion away from you in similar spots.",
        "Diana": "You played a bold assassin game, taking the early fail on Mission 2 and staying heavily involved in team selection, which kept you central to the action but also drew some heat. Your willingness to be on multiple critical teams was useful for evil, and with slightly more subtle distancing you could be nearly impossible to pin down.",
        "Eve": "Your Merlin play was strong in the midgame, especially with the clean success on Mission 3 that paired you with Alice and quietly signaled a likely good core. Later, your inclusion of me on Missions 4 and 5 gave evil the window to secure the win, suggesting that either your reads weren\u2019t fully locked in or you chose to conceal them a bit too much."

        "Charlie": "Blended in well as evil by sharing teams with me without drawing excessive suspicion, and let me take more of the visible leadership risk in the later missions.",
        "Eve": "Played a cautious Merlin game, avoiding overly strong accusations and instead influencing team selections subtly, which helped keep her alive but ultimately left just enough ambiguity for a successful assassination outcome."

        "Diana": "Managed the assassin role well by steering critical teams and creating just enough doubt around good players, especially by leveraging repeated leadership on missions 2, 4, and 5 to control outcomes and narratives."
