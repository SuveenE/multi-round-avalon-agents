        "Bob": "Balanced information-revealing and self-preservation well as Merlin, avoiding overly strong pushes that would have exposed him to the assassin. His presence on Missions 2 and 3 felt natural rather than forced, which is a sign he\u2019s good at looking like a standard, reasonable good player while quietly steering teams.",
        "Diana": "Came across as solid but somewhat low-impact: being on a clean Mission 2 helped her credibility, but she didn\u2019t strongly drive discussions or accusations. That quieter, cooperative style made her an easy include on teams, which is a strength, but could also limit her influence in tougher games.",
        "Eve": "Took a big swing with the assassin guess on me, showing she\u2019s willing to go with a confident read even when the evidence is ambiguous. Her choice suggests she reads visible consistency and central involvement on missions as Merlin indicators, which could be exploitable in future games if good players lean into low-key, shared responsibility instead."
