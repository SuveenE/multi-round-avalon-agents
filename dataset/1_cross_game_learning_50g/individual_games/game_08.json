A team of me\u2013Bob\u2013Eve is guaranteed to include exactly one evil (since it takes both from {Bob, Eve}), so it can never be an all-good team. In contrast, a mixed team of me\u2013Bob\u2013Charlie (one from {Charlie, Diana} and one from {Bob, Eve}) has a live possibility of being fully good if Charlie and Bob are the goods in their respective pairs.\n\nTable behavior also fits this: Charlie has consistently framed Diana as the more likely culprit from Mission 2 and avoided putting her back on, which is what I\u2019d expect from good if Diana is evil. Bob\u2019s preference for Alice\u2013Charlie\u2013Bob aligns with that same read. Meanwhile, Diana and Eve are aligned on pushing Alice\u2013Bob\u2013Eve, the configuration that is mathematically forced to contain exactly one evil.
