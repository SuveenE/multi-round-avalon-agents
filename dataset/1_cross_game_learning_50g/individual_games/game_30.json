I also didn\u2019t push hard enough to block Diana\u2019s mission 5 team despite its risky composition. In future games, I should challenge assumptions from early missions more aggressively and articulate my suspicions more clearly.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Bob": "Played a straightforward and trustworthy good game, consistently appearing reliable on missions and not over-pushing any particular narrative, which unfortunately made him easy to sideline in the endgame reads.",
        "Charlie": "Blended in very well after the successful mission 1, leveraging that early trust to get onto key teams and sabotage without drawing heavy suspicion until it was too late.",
        "Diana": "Played a quietly influential evil role, using leadership spots to propose subtly risky but still plausible teams and steering the final mission toward a composition that included herself without triggering a strong veto.",
        "Eve": "As Merlin, signaled just enough early to secure clean missions 1 and 2 but seemed hesitant to strongly oppose Diana and Charlie later, perhaps to avoid exposure, which allowed evil to slip into the critical late-game missions."

I should have more aggressively re-evaluated my read on Diana and Charlie after Mission 3 and 4, and I didn\u2019t do enough to protect Merlin or coordinate a clearly good bloc going into Mission 5.",

        "Alice": "Played cautiously and looked fairly transparent, but didn\u2019t strongly drive the table\u2019s logic when suspicion needed to shift after the first fail, which made it easier for evil to stay hidden.",
        "Charlie": "Blended in well as evil by accepting reasonable teams and only subtly steering outcomes, and the single-fail timing on Mission 3 was well-chosen to cast doubt without overexposing himself.",
        "Diana": "Played a very convincing social game, staying just under the radar while getting onto key teams and using the single-fail missions to keep her alignment ambiguous until late.",
        "Eve": "As Merlin, did a good job appearing generically good without being too loud, but their influence on team selection wasn\u2019t quite strong or clear enough to prevent the critical late-game fails."

        "Eve": "Eve, as Merlin, appeared careful not to over-clear or over-accuse specific players, but that caution sometimes translated into slightly vague guidance that wasn\u2019t strong enough to prevent critical evil team compositions."

I could improve by creating more explicit doubt on who the assassin should target at the end, as Merlin (Eve) was not under enough pressure or suspicion despite our mission successes and fails. Next time I should seed more soft pushes on multiple potential Merlins earlier so endgame is harder for good.",

        "Charlie": "As assassin, he balanced aggression and restraint well by not forcing early chaos, which kept suspicion from locking onto him too hard. His timing on supporting the failing missions was coordinated enough that evil maintained plausible deniability until late.",
        "Eve": "As Merlin, Eve read the game fairly well in terms of early mission safety but didn\u2019t push her suspicions hard enough to move the table off dangerous late-game teams. Her subtlety kept her relatively safe, but the lack of strong redirection on Missions 4 and 5 made it easier for us to secure consecutive fails."
