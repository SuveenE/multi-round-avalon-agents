      "self_assessment": "I did well at quietly steering teams toward the known good players, especially by reinforcing trust in Alice and Diana after the Mission 2 fail without over-explaining my reasoning. I could improve by better disguising my knowledge of evil, since my consistent support of the same teams eventually made me look slightly more informed than a normal good player should, even though the assassin still guessed wrong.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Played proactively and confidently as leader, willing to repeat similar teams, which helped build a clear trust narrative around her and Diana; her open style made her look like a natural Merlin candidate.",
        "Bob": "Managed to get a fail on Mission 2 without drawing overwhelming suspicion, suggesting a calm and measured evil playstyle that relies on blending in rather than loud misdirection.",
        "Diana": "Came across as consistently trustworthy and low-drama, which made it easy for others to accept teams with her on them and helped stabilize the good team\u2019s decision-making.",
        "Eve": "Assassin reasoning focused on visible influence and leadership, targeting the most obviously trusted and central player (Alice) rather than the more subtle guidance, indicating a tendency to equate loud impact with Merlin behavior."

      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Took initiative as leader and repeatedly chose a tight circle of trusted players, which helped good, but her overlap with the failed Mission 2 team made her look suspicious enough that the assassin picked her as Merlin.",
        "Bob": "Managed to slip a single fail into Mission 2 without drawing overwhelming suspicion, suggesting a cautious, low-profile evil playstyle that relies on blending into generally reasonable team choices.",
        "Charlie": "Played a very controlled and subtle Merlin game, quietly steering teams toward safe combinations without over-explaining, which kept them hidden enough that the assassin misfired onto Alice.",
        "Eve": "As assassin, relied heavily on perceived leadership influence and mission inclusion patterns when picking Merlin, suggesting a tendency to target the most visibly central good player rather than the most surgically accurate one."

      "self_assessment": "I stayed reasonably hidden as evil and leveraged the Mission 2 fail to create doubt, but I didn\u2019t correctly track who was consistently making strong, accurate team choices. I tunneled too hard on Alice as Merlin instead of re-evaluating after Missions 3 and 4, where Charlie\u2019s inclusion and the clean successes were big clues I should have weighed more heavily.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "She came across as consistently trustworthy and confident in team choices, which made her a natural lightning rod for suspicion as a possible Merlin. Her willingness to be on multiple successful teams without over-justifying her picks helped her blend in as generic \u2018solid good\u2019 rather than obviously informative.",
        "Bob": "He managed to get a fail onto Mission 2 without drawing overwhelming heat afterward, suggesting he\u2019s comfortable taking early risks and then cooling off. His play left enough ambiguity that I felt I still had room to maneuver in the assassination, even though we ultimately couldn\u2019t convert it.",
        "Charlie": "He hid his information well by not over-arguing and instead letting the mission results speak for his judgment, which made his Merlin play subtle enough that I overlooked him. His quiet but accurate presence on the later successful teams should have been a major signal that I failed to capitalize on.",
        "Diana": "She appeared reliably good and uncontroversial, often being included on successful teams without pushing a strong narrative, which made her feel like a \u2018safe default\u2019 pick. That low-drama style helped mask Merlin\u2019s identity by keeping focus on other players\u2019 decisions instead of her own."
