He projected a calm, logical good tone that made his reads feel very persuasive.",
        "Charlie": "Came across as straightforward and fairly transparent, especially with the clean Mission 1 and his willingness to go on key teams without over-defending anyone. His style seemed more reactive than driving, which made him look reliably good but not strongly directional.",
        "Diana": "Managed the early suspicion from the failed Mission 2 well by not over-defending herself and letting the game drift away from that data point. Her play was low-key and non-confrontational, which helped her blend in and avoid being locked in as evil despite strong reasons to doubt her.",

Her endgame read on Bob as Merlin suggests she was paying close attention to his team choices and tone throughout, even while staying relatively in the background politically."

        "Diana": "Blended in well by leaning into \u2018reasonable\u2019 team choices and avoiding overtly risky behavior, especially on the early missions; her subtle presence and low emotional spikes made it harder for good to confidently pin her as evil.",
        "Eve": "Played a bold but controlled game, especially around mission 3 and 4, managing to look flexible instead of scheming; her endgame reads and focus on my behavior during key team selections contributed directly to correctly identifying me as Merlin."

She didn\u2019t strongly distance herself from the failed Mission 4 team, which helped maintain ambiguity about her alignment.",
        "Bob": "Bob played cautiously and often ended up on important missions, which fits a typical Merlin pattern of wanting influence without being too obvious. His participation in both a success and a fail while maintaining a generally \u2018reasonable\u2019 table presence made him a high-information, high-risk target\u2014ultimately correctly identified in the assassin phase.",
        "Charlie": "Charlie\u2019s early leadership and willingness to include me on Mission 1 helped establish a trusting dynamic that I could exploit as evil. He tended to accept teams that felt \u2018safe\u2019 and logical, which made him look consistently good but also somewhat predictable in his approvals.",
        "Eve": "Eve balanced aggression and subtlety well, especially by helping secure a clean Mission 3 that reset some suspicions after the earlier fail. As assassin, Eve clearly tracked behavioral and mission patterns carefully enough to land on Bob as Merlin, converting an already tense game into a full evil victory."

        "Alice": "Tended to play cautiously and accept being on mixed teams, which made her look like a generic good rather than a power role; her participation on the failed Mission 4 without strongly pushing blame elsewhere reduced her Merlin equity. She seemed to follow the table\u2019s narrative more than drive it.",
        "Bob": "Showed subtle steering in team discussions and ended up on key missions (2, 4, 5) in a way that looked slightly too informed, especially avoiding obvious bad team constructions while not overexplaining his logic. His pattern of being repeatedly trusted while missions were mixed in success and failure strongly suggested a hidden information role, which pointed to Merlin.",
        "Charlie": "Played as a proactive but somewhat trusting good, willing to include a variety of players, including on the final mission, which helped him appear sincere but not especially informed. His leadership choices looked more like gut reads than information-driven picks, which made him a low-priority Merlin candidate.",
        "Diana": "Managed the early evil success well by getting Mission 2 to fail while not becoming the sole focus of suspicion afterward, distributing blame across the team. Her play balanced risk and caution effectively, helping maintain uncertainty about where the evil players were until the endgame."
