          "self_assessment": "I did reasonably well trusting the late-game team that led to three successful missions, but I was too slow to firmly suspect Charlie after Mission 2\u2019s fail and didn\u2019t vocalize enough doubt about him. I also didn\u2019t pay enough attention to how exposed Diana was becoming as Merlin, which contributed to her being assassinated. Next time, I should push harder on logical elimination earlier and think more about how our choices affect Merlin\u2019s cover, not just mission success.",
          "player_observations": {
            "Bob": "Bob played quite cautiously and gravitated toward consistent teams once they started succeeding, suggesting he relies heavily on empirical mission outcomes rather than early social reads. His leadership on Mission 5 showed he\u2019s willing to stick with a configuration that works, even without perfectly explaining every alignment.",
            "Charlie": "Charlie blended in well by anchoring early teams and riding the partial trust he built from Mission 1\u2019s success, showing he\u2019s comfortable using early-game information to mask his evil alignment. His leadership choices and apparent openness made him seem cooperative, which helped him avoid sustained scrutiny after the Mission 2 fail.",
            "Diana": "Diana gave strong, reasoned suggestions that often pointed correctly toward good teams, but some of her confidence may have made her look like Merlin to attentive evil players. She balanced giving guidance with not over-talking, yet her accuracy and late-game positioning still created enough of a pattern for the assassin to lock onto her.",
            "Eve": "Eve played a subtle but effective evil game by engineering or supporting key failing missions without drawing too much direct suspicion to herself. Her final assassination on Diana showed she was tracking who was consistently on good teams and who seemed to have better-than-average information, suggesting a methodical, observant style."

            "Charlie": "Tended to over-explain and justify his reasoning, which paradoxically made him look more suspicious when on failed teams; he seemed to trust logic over social reads, making him vulnerable to subtle framing.",

            "Eve": "Played Merlin cautiously, staying on a successful Mission 2 and the final failing Mission 5 without drawing heavy suspicion, which shows good subtlety.

He leaned on logical-sounding arguments to justify team choices, which helped him appear consistently good-aligned until late.",
