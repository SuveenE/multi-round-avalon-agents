Diana has been more cautious about reusing the failure overlaps and is not hard\u2011pushing any specific combo that obviously benefits a particular bloc.\n\nBetween Charlie, Eve, and Frank, I lean toward Charlie: Eve and Frank are the ones explicitly pushing to exclude me from the mission, which fits an evil agenda more often than a good one when I know I\u2019m clean.

Including Eve lets us avoid reusing the bulk of Mission 3 (we drop both Alice and Charlie) while still incorporating someone who wanted to test Bob/Diana without Alice. Frank\u2019s preference for a Diana-centered team with either Bob or Eve is also partially satisfied by this composition, which should make it broadly acceptable while giving us fresh, high-information results about where the fails are coming from.",
