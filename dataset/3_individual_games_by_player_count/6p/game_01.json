The main competing suggestions were: (a) Alice + Bob + Charlie, and (b) Alice + Bob + Diana. Multiple players (Diana, Frank) expressed concern that Charlie specifically pushed to remove Eve while keeping himself in, which is mildly suspicious. Bob and Diana both argued for the structural idea of exactly one of Alice/Eve plus two new players, and Frank independently converged on Alice + Bob + Diana. Between Charlie and Diana, Diana has attracted less suspicion so far and didn\u2019t push to place herself on the team as strongly as Charlie did. Frank also seems reasonable but cannot be included without dropping Bob or Diana and losing some of the consensus structure that\u2019s built up.
