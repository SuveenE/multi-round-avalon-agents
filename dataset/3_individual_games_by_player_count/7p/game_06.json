I\u2019ll take at most one of {Bob, Charlie, Frank} and completely exclude Frank, who only appears on the failed mission.\n- Mission 3 (Alice, Eve, Grace) failed with 1 FAIL, so at least one of {Alice, Grace} is evil (since I know I\u2019m good). I\u2019ll include at most one of them to avoid recreating that cluster.\n\n2) Choice within suspect groups:\n- From {Bob, Charlie, Frank}, Charlie is preferable to Frank (who is only on the failed mission) and to Bob, who already appears in the earlier fail cluster with Frank. Taking Charlie lets us test him without stacking too much of that failed trio.\n- From {Alice, Grace}, I choose Grace. Repeating Alice (who led and built the previously failing team) along with Charlie might over-concentrate potential evil narrative control, whereas Grace gives us a different mix from the previous fail.\n\n3) Diana as a fresh read:\n- Diana is completely untested so far and is widely treated as a neutral anchor by both sides. Including her gives us new information without pulling from any prior failing combination.\n\n4) Myself (Eve):\n- From my perspective as good, excluding myself means leaving the mission entirely in the hands of players drawn from the two failing groups, which feels worse than anchoring the team with a player I know is good.\n\nNet effect: This team avoids Frank, doesn\u2019t repeat the exact failing combinations from Missions 2 or 3, limits us to at most one member from each known-tainted set, and brings in Diana as fresh information. That structure maximizes our chance of a clean mission given what I know.",
