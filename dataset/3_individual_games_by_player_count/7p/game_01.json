Bob is still somewhat suspicious from mission 2, but if we fully exclude Diana and Frank, then among the remaining players (Alice, Bob, Charlie), Bob is the only one not from the mission 1 fail. Building around Eve and myself (Grace), who have no direct links to previous fails, and adding Bob creates the team with the fewest repeat connections to earlier failed missions while keeping the most suspicious players (Diana, Frank) off the team and not reuniting the Alice\u2013Charlie pair.",
