Now that this mission is a must-fail for evil, an actual evil on this same team would almost certainly play FAIL and out themselves, which is a terrible line for evil given how suspicious they would become with the score at 2\u20131. The alternative proposals that swap in untested players like Alice or Diana increase the raw probability of putting an evil on the team, because they throw out the only tested trio we have in favor of people with no track record.
