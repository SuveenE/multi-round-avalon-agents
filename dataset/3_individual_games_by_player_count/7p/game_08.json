To minimize overlap with the clearly suspicious pools, I want exactly one player from the Mission 2 pool and none from the Mission 1 pool. That means pairing me with either Alice or Charlie plus someone who hasn\u2019t been on any failed team yet. Diana was not on either failed team, so she\u2019s a strong candidate. Between Alice and Charlie, it\u2019s symmetric in terms of evidence, but several players (including me earlier) have already coalesced around Grace\u2013Alice\u2013Diana as a reasonable low-overlap test team. This lineup avoids Bob and Eve entirely (since at least one of them is evil) and also keeps Frank off (since he was on the second failed mission), while testing only a single player from the second fail pool. If this mission fails, suspicion focuses sharply on Alice vs. Diana; if it succeeds, we\u2019ve likely found a mostly clean core.",
