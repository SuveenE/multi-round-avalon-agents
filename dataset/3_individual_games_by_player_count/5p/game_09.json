Bob and Diana are the pair that successfully completed the only 2-person mission with no fails, and multiple people (including Diana and Eve) have argued that the final team should be Bob + Diana + either Alice or Eve. Between Alice and Eve, I think Eve makes more sense here because if Mission 2\u2019s double fail really meant both Eve and I are evil, then it would force Alice and Bob to both be good, which doesn\u2019t cleanly explain why every failed mission included at least one of Alice/Eve/Bob pushing hard narratives afterward. Building on Diana\u2019s own suggestion of Bob, Diana, and either Alice or Eve, I\u2019m choosing Bob, Diana, and Eve as the highest-compromise team that still keeps the \u2018proven\u2019 pair together while resolving the last slot in a way that doesn\u2019t just auto-reward the loudest voices.",

Mission 4 (Bob, Diana, Charlie) had exactly 1 FAIL; with Bob and Diana mechanically confirmed good, Charlie must be evil. That leaves the second evil as either Alice or Eve. In Mission 2\u2019s double-fail, we know Charlie (now confirmed evil) played one FAIL, and the other FAIL had to be from the remaining evil (Alice or Eve). Comparing discussion: Eve pushes a narrative that Bob might be evil despite the mechanical constraint that both evils are in {Alice, Charlie, Eve}, which does not fit a good player\u2019s information; meanwhile Alice\u2019s reasoning (that both Charlie and Eve are evil) is exactly what a good Alice would deduce after seeing 2 FAILs on a mission she was on. This strongly points to Eve as the second evil and Alice as good. Therefore the safest all-good team for the final mission is Alice, Bob, and Diana.",
