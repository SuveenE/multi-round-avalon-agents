Frank has voiced a preference for including Diana or Henry and has not been aggressively steering the narrative, which makes him a good complement to Alice without stacking only the loudest early pushers. This team balances the broad expectation that Alice be tested early with two players who are not at the center of the initial name-cycling, giving us cleaner alignment data from the result.",
