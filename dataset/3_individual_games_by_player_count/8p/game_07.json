Mission 1 failed with the team Alice, Charlie, and Grace, and since I know I\u2019m good, that points to at least one of Charlie or Grace being evil\u2014so I want to avoid both of them if possible. Diana hasn\u2019t appeared on a mission yet and isn\u2019t implicated by any fail, making her the safest neutral addition. So this team keeps the proven-successful Mission 2 core (Alice, Eve, Frank, Henry) and adds the least-tainted outside player (Diana) while avoiding the main suspicion clusters (Bob, and at least one of Charlie/Grace).",
