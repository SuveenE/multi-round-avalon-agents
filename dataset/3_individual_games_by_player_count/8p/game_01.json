Given how hard the table is pushing Henry off, and the fact that repeating the Henry/Eve combo from the double-fail is very risky, I want Henry and Eve both off this team. Between Bob and Charlie, both have been widely suggested as part of \u201csafer\u201d teams, and spreading risk by taking Bob and Charlie (instead of reusing Eve) seems better. On the Mission 3 side, a single fail there makes it unlikely that more than one of Alice/Frank/Grace is bad; multiple people are comfortable reusing them, and they\u2019re at the center of most proposed good-leaning cores. So this team (Alice, Bob, Charlie, Frank, Grace) keeps the most-suspected players (Henry, Diana, Eve) off, uses a strong core from Mission 3, and fills with the two most generally acceptable players from the Mission 2 set while avoiding the dangerous Henry/Eve pairing.",

On Quest 4 with 8 players, the mission requires 2 FAIL cards to fail. If we choose Bob plus all four from {Alice, Frank, Grace, Diana}, then by deduction that team must contain exactly 1 evil and 4 good players (since that set of four contains exactly 1 evil), and we take 0 players from {Charlie, Eve, Henry}, which avoids the dangerous pool containing 2 evils. With only a single evil on this mission, it is impossible for evil to produce the 2 FAIL cards required, so this team is mathematically guaranteed to succeed regardless of which one of Alice/Frank/Grace/Diana is evil.",

As Charlie I know I\u2019m good, so the three evils are: Henry, one of {Bob, Eve}, and one of {Alice, Frank, Grace, Diana}. We must pick 5 without Henry. Structurally we are forced to take: Charlie + one of {Bob, Eve} + three from {Alice, Frank, Grace, Diana}. Always taking all of {Alice, Frank, Grace} would guarantee including the single evil in that set, so it\u2019s better to mix in Diana and only take two from {Alice, Frank, Grace} to avoid a guaranteed spy. Table sentiment and prior discussions lean more towards Bob than Eve for trust, so I choose Bob as the single representative from {Bob, Eve}.
