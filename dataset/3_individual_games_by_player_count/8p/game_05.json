Combining this with total 3 evil overall, the structure must be: exactly 1 evil in {Grace, Charlie, Eve} and exactly 2 evil in {Alice, Diana, Frank, Henry}. Discussion-wise, Eve is the one consistently pushing to be on this team, while Grace is strongly pushing to keep Eve and Henry off; this pattern is more consistent with Eve being the spy and Grace/Charlie being good, so I\u2019m comfortable building around {Bob, Grace, Charlie}. That forces us to fill the last two slots from {Alice, Diana, Frank, Henry}. Henry has been on both failed missions and is widely distrusted, so I exclude him. That leaves {Alice, Diana, Frank}, among whom there is exactly one evil if Henry is the other. Picking two from three that contain exactly one spy gives a 1/3 chance that both are good, which is better than including Eve (who I currently rate as the most likely evil in the Grace/Charlie/Eve trio). Between Alice, Diana, and Frank, none is clearly cleared, but Alice was also on the clean first mission, and Diana\u2019s stance has been relatively consistent with a good player trying to avoid repeating bad overlaps, so I select Alice and Diana rather than bringing in Henry or the more self-effacing Frank. This yields the team: Bob (known good to me), Grace, Charlie (both likely good from structure and behavior), plus Alice and Diana as the least-bad pair from the mission-3 block while avoiding Henry and Eve as the highest-risk picks.",
