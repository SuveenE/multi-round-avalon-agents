Charlie and Diana have only ever been on clean missions, so they form the safest core we have. Between Grace and Henry, both have moved away from insisting on the original Bob/Grace/Henry core, which is more consistent with good reasoning after a fail; including them both does risk that one could be evil, but excluding both would force us to rely heavily on entirely untested players. Eve is added as a fresh test instead of Frank, who has been one of the strongest advocates of the original Bob/Grace/Henry core even after the fail, making him slightly more suspicious. This lineup balances minimizing exposure to the failed core (by excluding Bob and Alice), anchoring around the cleanest record (Charlie and Diana), and bringing in just enough of the suspect set to still gather useful information while aiming for a success.",
