As Charlie, I know I am good, so the single evil in {Charlie, Diana, Grace} must be either Diana or Grace. Therefore we must not take both Diana and Grace together, since that would guarantee one evil. Eve and Frank should stay off after the double-fail on Mission 2, and there is no reason to re-include them here. Between Alice and Bob, both are equally suspect from a pure probability standpoint (2 evils in {Alice, Bob, Eve, Frank}), but table talk has leaned slightly more toward trusting Alice over Bob. To minimize risk while still forming a legal team of four, I choose: Henry (effectively clear), myself Charlie (I know I\u2019m good), one of {Diana, Grace}\u2014I pick Diana\u2014and exactly one of {Alice, Bob}\u2014I pick Alice.
