Mission 3 (Diana, Iris, Jack, Bob) had 1 fail after Mission 2\u2019s success with Diana, Iris, Eve, Jack; the cleanest explanation is that Bob is evil rather than suddenly distrusting the whole Diana/Iris/Jack block that just succeeded. That makes the most suspect pool {Alice, Frank, Bob} plus possibly one of {Diana, Iris, Jack} as a deeper-level possibility. The only players never on a failed mission are Charlie, Eve, and Henry, so they form the safest core. I\u2019m including myself because I know I\u2019m good and leaving out Alice, Frank, and Bob entirely to eliminate the simplest evil explanations from the previous fails. For the Diana/Iris/Jack block, I include only one member (Diana) to minimize risk from that group while still leveraging the Mission 2 success signal.
