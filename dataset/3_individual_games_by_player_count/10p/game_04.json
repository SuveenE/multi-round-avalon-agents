To avoid the much-criticized Alice\u2013Bob\u2013Charlie trio and to keep information spread out, I\u2019m adding one person from outside that initial cluster; Grace fits well because she explicitly argued for breaking up the early block and for a more balanced, info-rich first team without strongly campaigning to be on it herself. This lineup respects the broad consensus of \u2018Alice + one of Bob/Charlie + one outside voice,\u2019 avoids a tight early core, and should be acceptable enough to pass while still generating useful alignment info.",
