Grace and Henry are both being framed as good info-generating picks with no strong suspicion yet, and adding Iris keeps the composition in line with the widely discussed Grace\u2013Henry\u2013Iris setup. Overall, this should be easier for the table to evaluate and approve, while giving us a clean baseline read from Mission 1 without overly committing to any early-game narrative.",
