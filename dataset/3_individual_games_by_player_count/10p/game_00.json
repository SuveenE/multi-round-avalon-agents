For the remaining slots, I want to limit exposure to the Mission 2 pool {Diana, Charlie, Grace, Henry}, which contains at least one spy from that single FAIL. By choosing only Diana and Charlie from that set and leaving Grace and Henry off, we reduce the chance of pulling multiple spies from that group while still using players who were part of the generally trusted cores people discussed. Bob and Eve are the only completely untested players and fit everyone\u2019s preference for building around people who haven\u2019t been on failed missions yet. So this team uses: (1) myself as a known-good to me from the double-fail team, (2) two untested players, and (3) exactly two from the Mission 2 suspect pool, minimizing overlap with both failing missions while still giving us a strong chance of a clean run.",

Bob and Eve are both completely untested so far, and most people have explicitly asked to see them on this mission. Diana and Grace give us experienced voices while still staying within the group that people have been comfortable with: they were each on a single\u2011fail mission, but that mission only had one FAIL total, so we know at worst there\u2019s limited spy presence between {Diana, Charlie, Grace, Henry}, and several people specifically suggested including one of Diana/Charlie plus Grace. For the last slot, almost everyone wanted exactly one of {Frank, Iris, Jack} from the double\u2011fail. I\u2019m choosing Jack here partly to avoid restacking Frank/Iris with each other, and partly because testing Jack alone (without Frank or Iris) gives us a very clear signal: if this mission fails, it strongly points back into that Mission 3 group; if it passes, that helps us narrow down where the second spy from that double\u2011fail actually was. This team matches the general structure most people were advocating\u2014Bob/Eve core, one of Diana/Charlie, Grace, and exactly one person from the double\u2011fail group\u2014while minimizing overlap and maximizing the info we get going into Mission 5.",

That means Bob is confirmed good by elimination. To minimize risk, we completely avoid the double-fail group {Frank, Alice, Iris, Jack} this mission and build around players who have not been on a failed team together. This team uses: Bob (logically clear), Charlie (me, and I know I\u2019m good), Diana and Grace (at most one of them can be a spy, since there is only one among {Diana, Grace, Henry}), and Eve (outside both previous fail teams and widely included in proposed cores). In the worst case this team can contain at most two spies (Eve plus at most one of Diana/Grace), and in some plausible role configurations it can be entirely clean. Given the game state (Good 1, Evil 2) and the need to avoid the double-fail block while leveraging the deduction that Bob is good and at most one of Diana/Grace is bad, this is the safest and most consistent team with prior discussion.",
