Henry has also been on both failed missions, which makes him too risky for this last team.

From the remaining pool, Grace has been on one success (Mission 1) and one fail (Mission 2) together with Bob, so if Bob is the main suspect for the repeated fails, Grace is more likely to be good than he is. Frank has not been on any mission teams, so he isn\u2019t directly tied to either of the failed results and represents the least entangled option.
