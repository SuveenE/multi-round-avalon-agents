Mission 1\u2019s fail points to at least one evil among Alice/Bob/Henry, but given Alice\u2019s presence on two clean missions and how strongly several players are now pushing to exclude her, I read Alice as more likely framed than genuinely evil. Bob and Henry only appear on the first failed mission and bring extra risk, so I keep them off. Grace is the sole new factor on the second fail and therefore stays off as well. Between the untested options Frank and Iris, I choose Frank as the fifth since we must add someone outside the fail-heavy Alice/Bob/Henry/Grace cluster, and including exactly one unproven player with the proven core seems safer than rebuilding around two untested players.
