As Henry, I\u2019m a quieter player who multiple people (Eve, Frank, Grace, Iris, Henry) suggested as a good third to avoid stacking only heavy talkers, and including myself lets others get a read on me early. Overall, Alice + Grace + Henry is the most consensus-aligned and information-generating low-risk configuration from the discussed options.",

For the fourth slot, the group sentiment has generally favored adding either Frank or me, and I previously voiced support for exactly this structure.
