It also keeps Alice and Bob from being locked together right away, which multiple players said they were uncomfortable with, and it avoids over\u2011tuning the first mission with too many agenda\u2011shaping players. Starting with this fairly standard mix should give us useful information from both the mission result and the voting patterns without feeling like anyone is being unfairly targeted or protected on Mission 1.",
