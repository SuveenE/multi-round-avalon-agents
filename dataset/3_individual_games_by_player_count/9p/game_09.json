Grace was on the most recent failed mission and already had skepticism around her, so I\u2019m leaving her off as well. Frank is being advocated for mostly by the same people pushing to recycle from recent suspect pools, so I\u2019d rather avoid him this round too. That leaves Bob, Henry, and Eve as the most acceptable additions: Bob and Diana were both on the Mission 2 fail, but that mission only had a single fail card, so at most one of {Alice, Bob, Charlie, Diana} is bad, and Charlie\u2019s double-fail overlap makes him the far more likely culprit. Eve\u2019s only appearance was on the Mission 3 fail alongside the already highly suspect Charlie and Grace, making her relatively safer than them. Overall, this team keeps the trusted Mission 1 core, avoids the heaviest suspicion from the double-fail overlap, and builds around the most consistently argued-for safer picks from discussion.",
