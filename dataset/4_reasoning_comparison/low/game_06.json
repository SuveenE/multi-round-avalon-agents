Since we know the two evil players are Eve and exactly one of {Alice, Charlie}, the only fully good trios that include me are {Bob, Diana, Alice} if Alice is good or {Bob, Diana, Charlie} if Charlie is good. Both are structurally valid, but Alice also led the failed Mission 3 and has only appeared on a failing team, while Charlie at least aligns with the clean M1 core plus a single new add.
