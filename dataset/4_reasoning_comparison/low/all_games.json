By excluding Charlie this round, we directly test a completely new trio relative to Mission 1 and force evil (if on this team) to reveal themselves earlier. Between the remaining players, Bob and Alice are both untested and were the main candidates everyone was circling around; putting them together with me gives maximum information: if this mission passes clean, it strongly points suspicion toward Charlie/Eve; if it fails, we\u2019ll know at least one of Bob/Alice is evil and can use votes and reactions to refine that. This balances a real shot at success with high informational value, instead of just trusting the previous leader\u2019s preferred extension of the original core.",
