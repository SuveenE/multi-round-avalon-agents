That \u201cif people are spooked by me going three\u2011for\u2011three I\u2019m fine with an Alice+Charlie team\u201d line also sounds like Merlin who knows any two of ABC are safe and is deliberately offering to sit out so he doesn\u2019t look too perfectly on every clean mission.",

Charlie looks least like Merlin to me because early on he\u2019s happy to talk about \u201cmixing in Diana/Eve/me\u201d and even using us as a pivot if ABC fails, which Merlin would never genuinely want given perfect info.",
