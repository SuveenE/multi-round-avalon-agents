Alice, on the other hand, was willing to self-exclude and argue to keep both herself and Eve off the team, which is more consistent with a good player caught on a failed mission than with someone desperate to get back on a critical quest. Given that, the best risk profile is to avoid both Charlie and Eve and go with the players most aligned with the successful missions and less suspicious discussion: Bob, Alice, and Diana.",
