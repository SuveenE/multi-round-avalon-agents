Between those two, Diana\u2019s comments strongly suggest she deduced Bob as the saboteur from her perspective (which only a good Diana could do) and she therefore distrusts Bob\u2019s push for Eve and prefers Alice+Charlie. Bob, who is highly likely to be evil from this, specifically pushes for Alice+Eve, which makes Eve more suspicious by association.

That leaves Charlie and Diana as the most reliable core (they\u2019ve both been on successful missions without any recorded fails together), and between the remaining two high\u2011suspicion players (Bob and me), we have to pick exactly one to complete a team of three.

The Bob+Charlie and Diana+Charlie cases both require Charlie (as a lone spy on Mission 3) to have voluntarily passed on a 2-player mission that would have given evil a 2\u20131 lead, which is strategically unlikely, so I downweight those. That leaves {Bob, Eve} and {Diana, Eve} as the most plausible spy pairs. The table talk makes {Diana, Eve} much more consistent: both Diana and Eve are pushing hard to build the last team around Diana+Charlie and to sideline Bob, which perfectly fits a Diana+Eve spy team trying to ensure Diana is on the final mission and to keep the only all-good trio (Alice, Bob, Charlie) off the table.

Charlie has led both failing missions and is now both (a) calling Alice the common factor in fails and yet (b) still willing to go back to an Alice\u2013Eve core if others want it, which feels like positioning rather than consistent good reasoning. Bob, on the other hand, has a more mechanically grounded perspective from Mission 4: he knows he\u2019s good, correctly notes the fail had to come from Alice or Eve, and is willing to put himself back on the line on a team that *cuts Eve* and avoids Charlie. If the spies are among {Charlie, Eve} plus one of {Alice/B}, the team [Alice, Bob, Diana] is the composition that best fits seeing Bob as likely good and wanting to avoid both Charlie\u2019s suspicious leadership record and Eve\u2019s hard push to get herself back onto the final mission via the \u2018safe\u2019 Alice\u2013Eve narrative.",
