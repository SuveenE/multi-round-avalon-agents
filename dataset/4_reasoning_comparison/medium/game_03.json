Taking Alice\u2013Bob\u2013Diana aligns with what several people already floated: it keeps the one player who\u2019s been on a successful team while introducing two new slots to actually generate fresh info. Yes, it\u2019s true (as Eve said) that putting two totally untested players together can make a fail a bit fuzzier, but as leader I\u2019m willing to put myself on the line here: if this team fails, the suspicion appropriately falls on the new additions (primarily me and Diana) rather than on Alice, who\u2019s been part of the only clean result so far.

Charlie has led both failing missions and is now both (a) calling Alice the common factor in fails and yet (b) still willing to go back to an Alice\u2013Eve core if others want it, which feels like positioning rather than consistent good reasoning. Bob, on the other hand, has a more mechanically grounded perspective from Mission 4: he knows he\u2019s good, correctly notes the fail had to come from Alice or Eve, and is willing to put himself back on the line on a team that *cuts Eve* and avoids Charlie. If the spies are among {Charlie, Eve} plus one of {Alice/B}, the team [Alice, Bob, Diana] is the composition that best fits seeing Bob as likely good and wanting to avoid both Charlie\u2019s suspicious leadership record and Eve\u2019s hard push to get herself back onto the final mission via the \u2018safe\u2019 Alice\u2013Eve narrative.",
