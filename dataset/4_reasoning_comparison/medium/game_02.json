The two fails both came from small, info-dense teams: Mission 2 (Eve\u2013Alice\u2013Charlie) and Mission 3 (Bob\u2013Diana). Treating those as each containing exactly one evil, the clean overlap structure points most strongly to Charlie and Diana as the likely evil pair. Any world where one of Alice/Bob/Eve is evil requires them to have voluntarily passed a win-on-fail mission, which is a much riskier, lower-percentage evil line than simply failing Mission 4. Given the stakes on Quest 5, the safest play is to rerun the proven-clean Mission 4 team without introducing new variance.",
