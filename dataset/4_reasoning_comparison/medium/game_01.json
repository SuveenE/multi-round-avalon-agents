Bob, who is highly likely to be evil from this, specifically pushes for Alice+Eve, which makes Eve more suspicious by association.

The Bob+Charlie and Diana+Charlie cases both require Charlie (as a lone spy on Mission 3) to have voluntarily passed on a 2-player mission that would have given evil a 2\u20131 lead, which is strategically unlikely, so I downweight those. That leaves {Bob, Eve} and {Diana, Eve} as the most plausible spy pairs. The table talk makes {Diana, Eve} much more consistent: both Diana and Eve are pushing hard to build the last team around Diana+Charlie and to sideline Bob, which perfectly fits a Diana+Eve spy team trying to ensure Diana is on the final mission and to keep the only all-good trio (Alice, Bob, Charlie) off the table. Under the Diana+Eve spy pairing, the only completely good team is exactly {Alice, Bob, Charlie}, so that is the team I propose.",
