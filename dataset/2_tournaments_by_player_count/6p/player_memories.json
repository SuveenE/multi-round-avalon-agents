            "Charlie": "Subtly guided team selections without drawing too much attention, giving just enough resistance at key moments to steer us away from worse lineups. His balance of influence and restraint was very Merlin-like in hindsight, but in real time it was just quiet, credible leadership.",
            "Diana": "Stayed relatively low-impact this game, which made her harder to pin as evil and kept suspicion from focusing on her. Her lack of strong pushes likely helped her Morgana role avoid being heavily scrutinized.",

            "Eve": "As Morgana, she did a good job mirroring a reasonable good player, but we didn\u2019t sync our stories tightly enough to sell a cohesive false Merlin narrative. Her willingness to go along with the later safe teams contributed to her staying mostly unchallenged but also didn\u2019t create enough misdirection at the end.",
            "Frank": "Came off as a bit more suspicious after Mission 1 but then played in a way that didn\u2019t strongly challenge the emerging consensus, which ironically helped him fade into the background as a plausible but not priority suspect. His relatively quiet presence made him an appealing\u2014but ultimately wrong\u2014assassination guess."

I could improve by more aggressively questioning the Alice/Eve axis earlier, as I let their conflicting narratives shape too much of the mid-game discussion instead of driving my own logic consistently.",
          "player_observations": {
            "Alice": "You played a very assertive evil Mordred, using the early fail on Mission 1 to seed long-lasting doubt on me while keeping just enough ambiguity around yourself to avoid being hard-cleared as evil too early. Your willingness to let others (especially Bob and Diana) steer mission compositions while you stayed vocally analytical helped you blend in for longer than I expected after a failed lead.",
            "Bob": "As Percival, you leaned heavily into structured logic and consistency checks, which made your support for Diana later feel very convincing and stabilizing for the good team. You did a good job not over-clearing either Merlin candidate too loudly, which helped protect Diana, though at times your focus on tight, low-variance teams probably made you look a bit controlling.",
            "Charlie": "You played a very low-drama, steady good role, and your willingness to repeatedly go on the same teams (even after a fail) suggested you were trusting the information flow more than trying to hero-guess. Your calm acceptance of being on both a failed and successful team without over-defensiveness made you look quite genuine and helped solidify the core good block.",
            "Diana": "Your Merlin play was subtle and measured; you nudged team selections in the right direction (especially Missions 2 and 4) without ever hard-accusing Alice or Eve in a way that would expose you. The way you let some suspicion sit on me while still keeping me in the final mission team was a nice balance between protecting your identity and steering good to victory.",
            "Eve": "As Morgana you did a strong job mirroring good logic and staying tightly paired with Alice in a way that made the evil team look internally consistent, especially around Mission 3\u2019s fail. Your presence on both a failed and then a proposed final mission without pushing too hard to be included helped keep you from being the obvious scapegoat, even though your eventual exclusion from the last team was key to good\u2019s success."

I could have done a better job subtly steering people away from trusting Alice and Eve earlier\u2014especially after the double-fail on Mission 3\u2014without making my reads look too informed or decisive.",
          "player_observations": {
            "Alice": "You played aggressively and leaned into early trust, which made you a very plausible Merlin candidate after Mission 1 and 2 succeeded cleanly with you on both. The double-fail on Mission 3 was big, but you still maintained enough ambiguity that evil could have reasonably hoped you\u2019d be read as Merlin over me.",
            "Bob": "You played very straightforwardly and consistent with a loyal good, which made you look mechanically clean but not overly insightful\u2014likely why you were a comfortable Merlin guess for the assassin. Your willingness to go on high-risk teams (like the Mission 3 lineup) without overdefending them helped you avoid looking too calculating.",
            "Charlie": "You seemed to approach the game methodically, and as Percival you did a good job keeping suspicion spread between multiple Merlin candidates rather than tunneling. Your team choices, especially putting me on Mission 4, suggested you had some quiet reads but you didn\u2019t broadcast them loudly enough to expose Merlin.",
            "Diana": "You played a low-drama, logic-first game and your leadership on Mission 2 created a clean, trustworthy baseline for others to anchor on. Your choices and table talk felt very classically good, which helped reduce chaos and gave me room to make subtle nudges without needing to overexplain anything.",
            "Eve": "Your evil play was patient\u2014you didn\u2019t push too hard early, which made your inclusion on the big Mission 3 team feel natural and unforced. The two FAILs there were brutal for good, and you handled the aftermath well by not overjustifying yourself, preserving enough ambiguity that suspicion didn\u2019t lock solely on you."

            "Alice": "Played a very convincing Morgana, leaning into early team proposals that looked safe and not overpushing any sabotage, which made her feel like a cautious but cooperative good player. Her subtlety and lack of overt agenda pressure helped keep suspicion off her despite being evil.",
            "Bob": "Came across as straightforward and consistent, with decisions that matched a typical good-player risk profile and no noticeable over-defensiveness, which made it easier to trust him. His willingness to go on early teams without hedging or angling for complex logic supported the image of a genuinely good agent.",
            "Charlie": "Behaved like a careful information-gatherer, asking questions and evaluating team compositions in a way that matched a typical Percival profile. He didn\u2019t tunnel too hard on any single read, which helped keep both Merlin candidates (Alice and me) plausibly in play for much of the game.",
            "Diana": "Played a low-drama, cooperative style that fit well with a solid, dependable good role, especially by accepting and performing on early teams without creating noise. Her lack of strong agenda-driving made her an easy inclusion for missions once early successes started to stack up.",
            "Eve": "Stayed relatively under the radar, which is often effective for Mordred, avoiding big, risky pushes that would draw attention to alignment. By not placing herself in key mission spots or debate focal points too aggressively, she made it harder for good to justify explicit suspicion without looking paranoid."
