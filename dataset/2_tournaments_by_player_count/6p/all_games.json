Bob is the only player who has been on every single team, including both fails, which makes him the most dangerous to keep on the decider.

Crucially, at most one of Charlie/Diana can be evil, because we already know there is at least one evil in the Alice/Bob/Eve trio from the fail on Mission 3 when I was present. Therefore, a team built around Charlie and Diana with me included minimizes the chance of hitting two evils outside that trio. To break the poisoned core, we remove Bob entirely and bring in only one of Alice/Eve.
