      "self_assessment": "I stayed relatively under the radar as Mordred while still being on the key failing team for Mission 2, which helped create enough doubt around others rather than myself. I could improve by more actively shaping the table narrative mid-game\u2014especially pushing stronger, believable theories about who Merlin might be to further misdirect good after the mission failures started piling up.",

        "Alice": "Tended to build trust through conservative team choices, which made her seem reliably good but also a bit passive in driving accusations and big-picture reads.",
        "Bob": "Played very engaged and central, which fit well with Percival\u2014he tried to anchor the table\u2019s logic, but that visibility also made him easier to manipulate with misleading signals from evil.",
        "Charlie": "Came across as quieter and more reactive, often following the momentum of others\u2019 reads rather than pushing strong independent theories, which made them a convenient player to keep in \u2018uncertain but probably good\u2019 territory.",
        "Diana": "Leaned into a confident, proactive style as Morgana, which helped sell a strong pseudo-Merlin/percival identity and added confusion about information accuracy for the good team.",
        "Frank": "Played a solid Merlin in terms of picking decent teams early, but stayed just cautious enough in hard-calling evils that it left room for us to muddy perceptions of who actually had good information."

        "Charlie": "Played a relatively low-key, reactive game, often following emerging consensus; this made him look quite village but also limited his impact on correcting bad team directions.",
        "Diana": "Blended in very well as Morgana by taking leadership spots and proposing plausible teams, using just enough apparent flexibility to avoid looking like the clear source of fails.",
        "Eve": "As Mordred, stayed just outside the center of suspicion, influencing outcomes through a mix of quiet positioning and one key fail that didn\u2019t fully implicate her, making her hard to nail down.",
