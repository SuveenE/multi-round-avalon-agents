However, I failed to scrutinize Alice\u2019s alignment before adding her to Mission 2 and didn\u2019t adjust strongly enough after later fails to push more aggressively for alternate team compositions.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Played a very effective Morgana, blending in as a reasonable, pickable choice for early missions and using that trust to sneak a fail onto Mission 2 without drawing overwhelming suspicion.",
        "Bob": "As Percival, Bob consistently positioned himself near the center of mission teams and projected a generally trustworthy vibe, but he seemed to struggle to clearly distinguish Merlin from Morgana and to steer teams away from hidden evil.",
        "Diana": "As Merlin, Diana played cautiously, not over-pushing her reads, which protected her identity but may have made it harder for the team to decisively converge on fully good mission lineups.",
        "Eve": "As Mordred, Eve stayed effectively under the radar, getting onto later mission teams and contributing fails while not becoming an obvious focal point of accusations.",
        "Frank": "Frank played like a generally cooperative good player, joining a crucial late mission that failed, but didn\u2019t exert strong influence on team selections or arguments, which made it easier for evil to guide the game\u2019s direction."

My team choice on Mission 3 (including Eve) and my weak pushback on Mission 4\u2019s team composition let evil secure consecutive fails.

        "Bob": "As Percival, seemed to be actively searching for Merlin but may have overweighted social reads over mission results, occasionally defending or accepting risky team members when there was safer information on the board.",
        "Charlie": "Played cautiously and looked genuinely good-aligned, but did not press hard enough on the implications of Mission 2\u2019s fail, which could have locked in Alice as the prime evil suspect earlier.",
        "Eve": "Very quiet, low-profile evil presence who benefited from not being on the early missions and then slipping onto crucial later teams (3 and 4) without drawing sufficient heat\u2014good at hiding in the \u201cneutral\u201d space.",
        "Frank": "Came across as transparently good, but as leader late in the game defaulted to comfort picks instead of rigorously eliminating suspects from prior mission data, which allowed Eve to stay on the critical Mission 4 team."

      "self_assessment": "I stayed sufficiently under the radar while still ensuring key missions failed, which helped evil secure a relatively smooth win.

      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Played Morgana assertively, taking early mission spots and providing a strong second evil presence that blended well with good, especially on Mission 2. Her style suggests she\u2019s comfortable being central to the action and can convincingly occupy a \u2018helpful good\u2019 persona.",
        "Bob": "As Percival, he seemed inclined to trust a small core early and stick with them, which is strong if his Merlin read is right but exploitable if it\u2019s wrong. He did not appear overly paranoid after the first fail, suggesting he values consistency in teams over aggressive reshuffling.",
        "Charlie": "Played relatively straightforward and low-flash, which is a solid default good style but can make it hard for others to strongly townread him. He didn\u2019t strongly push narratives after the Mission 2 fail, which may indicate a more cautious or conflict-averse approach.",
        "Diana": "As Merlin, she steered teams subtly rather than overtly, which helped her avoid looking too \u2018all-knowing\u2019 while still nudging composition. Her style leans toward quiet influence rather than loud accusation, which is strong but can leave good without clear, vocal direction in tense spots.",
        "Frank": "Approached team selection and voting in a way that seemed genuinely good-leaning and uncoordinated, making him a believable innocent anchor for teams. He appeared to trust table consensus more than forcefully drive it, suggesting he\u2019s more comfortable supporting than leading in deduction-heavy roles."
