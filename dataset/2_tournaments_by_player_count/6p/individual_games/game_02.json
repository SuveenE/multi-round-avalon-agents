His late-game positioning made him look suspicious enough to draw the assassin shot, which was great for good but also suggested he might have over-signaled trust in the wrong spots.",
        "Eve": "Played low-key and relatively quiet, generally following the emerging consensus while avoiding drawing suspicion. Her voting pattern was consistent and supportive of good teams, though she could probably influence table talk more to pressure evil players.",
        "Frank": "Blended in very well as Mordred by participating on early successful missions, gaining a lot of trust from the table. The fact that Mission 3 had two fails with him on it highlighted how much credibility he\u2019d banked beforehand, making it hard for good to fully pin him down immediately."

        "Charlie": "As Percival, seemed somewhat conflicted about trust but ultimately didn\u2019t lock hard onto Alice as Merlin, which helped keep her safe but may have weakened his influence.",

      "self_assessment": "I stayed consistently trusted through the first two missions and helped set up a deceptive narrative going into the larger team of Mission 3, which let evil get a key fail through. However, I didn\u2019t do enough to cast doubt on Alice as Merlin or to create stronger alternative Merlin candidates, making it easier for good to survive the assassination. In future games I should be more vocal in shaping suspicion patterns and coordinating my visible behavior with other evil players.",

        "Alice": "Played a very controlled Merlin game, giving just enough soft guidance to keep early missions clean while not drawing too much direct suspicion. Her consistent inclusion of the right mixes on teams made her look like a solid, rational good player rather than an obvious seer.",
        "Bob": "As Morgana, Bob blended in well and supported team choices that kept evil from being exposed too early, especially on Missions 1 and 2. He did not over-claim information, which helped reduce the contrast between his play and Alice\u2019s more subtly informed decisions.",
        "Charlie": "Charlie played an active, central role and was willing to be on multiple critical teams, which is typical of a confident good player or a bold evil player. As Percival, he didn\u2019t clearly out Alice or Bob as Merlin/Morgana to us, which helped keep the Merlin identity ambiguous from the evil side.",
        "Diana": "Diana showed a straightforward, conservative playstyle, proposing a small, clean team for Mission 4 that signaled strong \u2018by-the-book\u2019 good alignment. She didn\u2019t push many loud accusations, which made her look stable but not particularly information-driving.",
        "Eve": "Eve appeared cautious and somewhat low-profile, which is often interpreted as generic good unless paired with strong contradictory data. Her inclusion on the final successful mission reinforced an image of quiet reliability rather than someone steering the table\u2019s narrative."
