Bob is the only player who has been on every single team, including both fails, which makes him the most dangerous to keep on the decider. Among the non-core players, I know I\u2019m good; that means the two evils must be either (1) one or two in {Alice, Bob, Eve} plus possibly one of {Charlie, Diana}, or (2) both in {Alice, Bob, Eve}. Crucially, at most one of Charlie/Diana can be evil, because we already know there is at least one evil in the Alice/Bob/Eve trio from the fail on Mission 3 when I was present. Therefore, a team built around Charlie and Diana with me included minimizes the chance of hitting two evils outside that trio. To break the poisoned core, we remove Bob entirely and bring in only one of Alice/Eve.

However, I failed to clearly steer missions 3\u20135 away from the double-evil core of Bob/Charlie without outing myself, and I didn\u2019t do enough to keep suspicion and mission leadership pressure focused on Bob after the first fail.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Played very proactively and embraced mission leadership, which fit well with being a visible good role; her willingness to go on risky teams made her look bold but occasionally gave evil good cover.",
        "Bob": "Maintained a very steady, trustworthy presence as Mordred, leveraging the early successes to anchor himself as \u2018confirmed-ish\u2019 and then slipping a single fail into mid/late missions in a controlled way.",
        "Charlie": "Stayed relatively under the radar while quietly aligning with evil outcomes, letting others drive team discussions; felt like a classic support-evil style that avoids drawing direct suspicion.",
        "Eve": "Played cautiously good, generally accepting consensus teams and not forcing strong counter-narratives, which made her look sincere but also made it easier for evil to co-opt her trust.",
        "Frank": "Showed a mix of skepticism and flexibility, but as a good player he sometimes gave too much benefit of the doubt to early successful lineups, which let evil sneak onto his later mission without heavy challenge."

      "self_assessment": "I did well maintaining a consistently trustworthy presence, which helped get early good teams approved and kept suspicion relatively low on me throughout the game. However, I could have pushed harder to re-evaluate my reads after the first fail on Mission 3 and been more vocal about resisting later teams that mixed too many previously exposed or risky players, especially around Frank\u2019s final team.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Played a solid, proactive info role; her willingness to go on multiple critical teams and take leadership made her look confident and good-aligned, though she may have overtrusted Bob for too long.",
        "Bob": "Very steady and composed; he leveraged early mission success to cement massive trust and avoided drawing attention even after being on multiple pivotal teams, a classic, low-flash but highly effective evil style.",
        "Charlie": "Stayed mostly in the background and avoided major team spots until the final mission, which kept suspicion low and allowed evil to preserve a hidden resource for the endgame.",
        "Diana": "Projected calm, logical leadership and constructed believable narratives that fit the mission results, which is exactly what made her Merlin reads blend nicely into normal good play.",
        "Frank": "Came across as earnest and generally trustworthy but a bit indecisive; as leader on Missions 3 and 5, he seemed to lean too much on established trust (especially in Bob) rather than aggressively challenging earlier assumptions."

      "self_assessment": "I was too slow to lock in on Bob as the consistent source of mission fails and let that uncertainty push me into a risky final-team choice that included Charlie instead of a more statistically safe configuration. I did reasonably well trusting Diana and Eve by the end, but I should have pushed harder against keeping Bob on missions after Mission 3 and recognized the pattern of single-fail missions pointing to him.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Played a very central information role and built trust early with clean missions, but her association with Bob on the failing Mission 4 made reading her alignment tricky from my perspective.",
        "Bob": "Blended in extremely well as evil by anchoring early successful missions and then consistently sabotaging from inside trusted teams, leveraging that trust so we kept including him despite the pattern of single fails.",
        "Charlie": "Stayed relatively under the radar for most of the game and benefited from not being heavily tested on early missions, which made it easier for you to slip onto the final team as hidden evil.",
        "Diana": "Your play as Merlin was subtle but not forceful; you seemed to avoid hard accusations, which kept you safe but also made it harder for me to confidently follow your reads.",
        "Eve": "Came across as steadily good and trustworthy through repeated successful missions and calm team selections, though your presence on failing teams with Bob made it hard to completely clear you until late."
