By choosing Bob\u2013Charlie\u2013Diana, we (1) maximize the chance of a clean team by fully avoiding the Alice/Frank pair, (2) align with multiple players\u2019 stated preferences for Charlie/Diana involvement, and (3) create a clear information point: if this team passes and succeeds, suspicion concentrates heavily on Alice/Frank; if it fails, we can narrow evil to within this trio and re-evaluate Alice/Frank accordingly.",

        "Eve": "As Morgana, she did a good job mirroring a reasonable good player, but we didn\u2019t sync our stories tightly enough to sell a cohesive false Merlin narrative. Her willingness to go along with the later safe teams contributed to her staying mostly unchallenged but also didn\u2019t create enough misdirection at the end.",

His relatively quiet presence made him an appealing\u2014but ultimately wrong\u2014assassination guess."

He projected confidence in Diana early, which helped good but also slightly telegraphed where Merlin might be.",
        "Diana": "As Merlin, she guided team selections subtly by consistently supporting the Bob/Charlie combo and avoiding Alice/Eve where possible, without making hard accusations that would expose her. Her calm acceptance of certain risky-looking teams made them feel safer and ultimately helped good get the last two successes.",
        "Eve": "Played an assertive mid-game role and used her presence on the failing Mission 3 to create ambiguity around whether the bad card came from her or from one of the previously trusted players.

        "Frank": "Your early involvement on the failed M1 made you look suspicious for a while, but your later mission behavior and voting patterns helped clear you. You played a relatively low-key good game, which made you a plausible Merlin target and ultimately helped keep attention off me."

Your team selections and mission reads were subtle enough that evil couldn\u2019t confidently lock onto you, especially with how well you coordinated implicitly with Bob.",

        "Alice": "You played a very assertive evil Mordred, using the early fail on Mission 1 to seed long-lasting doubt on me while keeping just enough ambiguity around yourself to avoid being hard-cleared as evil too early. Your willingness to let others (especially Bob and Diana) steer mission compositions while you stayed vocally analytical helped you blend in for longer than I expected after a failed lead.",
        "Bob": "As Percival, you leaned heavily into structured logic and consistency checks, which made your support for Diana later feel very convincing and stabilizing for the good team. You did a good job not over-clearing either Merlin candidate too loudly, which helped protect Diana, though at times your focus on tight, low-variance teams probably made you look a bit controlling.",
        "Charlie": "You played a very low-drama, steady good role, and your willingness to repeatedly go on the same teams (even after a fail) suggested you were trusting the information flow more than trying to hero-guess. Your calm acceptance of being on both a failed and successful team without over-defensiveness made you look quite genuine and helped solidify the core good block.",
        "Diana": "Your Merlin play was subtle and measured; you nudged team selections in the right direction (especially Missions 2 and 4) without ever hard-accusing Alice or Eve in a way that would expose you. The way you let some suspicion sit on me while still keeping me in the final mission team was a nice balance between protecting your identity and steering good to victory.",
        "Eve": "As Morgana you did a strong job mirroring good logic and staying tightly paired with Alice in a way that made the evil team look internally consistent, especially around Mission 3\u2019s fail. Your presence on both a failed and then a proposed final mission without pushing too hard to be included helped keep you from being the obvious scapegoat, even though your eventual exclusion from the last team was key to good\u2019s success."
