I could improve by crafting a clearer, more believable Merlin candidate persona to more strongly mislead Grace-as-Percival, since my Morgana presence didn\u2019t seem to fully hijack their trust.",

            "Diana": "You projected a very \u2018solid villager\u2019 vibe, consistently logical and calm, but you didn\u2019t hard-push your suspicions, which let evil slip through a couple of critical team votes.",
            "Eve": "You played quite transparently good, but your trust calibration felt shaky at times, which evil leveraged when you supported some mixed teams without fully locking in who you distrusted.",
            "Frank": "You were willing to put bold teams on the table, but your explanations sometimes lagged behind your choices, which made you look a bit erratic and easier to frame as suspicious.",
            "Grace": "As Percival you were actively hunting for Merlin, but you seemed torn between multiple candidates and never fully committed, which weakened good\u2019s ability to rally around a trusted core.",
            "Henry": "You stayed well-camouflaged as assassin, not overreaching for control and letting others drive the table talk, which made your eventual assassination decision more informed and less pressured.",

          "self_assessment": "I coordinated the single fail on Mission 3 reasonably well to create some doubt, but I tunneled too hard on Diana and didn't reevaluate when Mission 4 passed cleanly with Eve on it. I need to pay more attention to subtle behavioral cues and team-selection logic instead of over-weighting who was on the failed mission.",

I also failed to give Iris (Percival) clear enough signals about who was likely Morgana versus Merlin, which made it easier for evil to control the narrative and ultimately for the Assassin to land the right shot.",
          "player_observations": {
            "Bob": "As Assassin, Bob managed to stay in enough successful-looking teams to appear plausible while still being on key failed missions, and he used that ambiguity well in the endgame to make a confident Merlin guess.",
            "Charlie": "Charlie played a very straightforward, good-leaning style, generally supporting what seemed like safe teams and not over-arguing, which made them look reliably good but also a bit passive in driving alternative team proposals.",
            "Diana": "Diana seemed engaged and thoughtful in team discussions, and her presence on the failed Mission 2 didn\u2019t draw as much heat as it could have, suggesting she was good at deflecting suspicion without over-defending herself.",
            "Eve": "Eve (Mordred) stayed impressively under the radar after the Mission 2 fail, managing to avoid becoming the focal point of suspicion even when logic could have pointed her way, which let evil preserve flexibility for later missions.",
            "Frank": "Frank showed a cautious, logic-driven approach, often aligning with what seemed like the consensus of reasonable teams, which helped him read as reliably good but may have limited how much he challenged deceptive narratives from evil.",
            "Grace": "Grace (Morgana) did a strong job of muddying the Merlin signal, presenting herself as someone with confident reads, which likely contributed to confusion for Percival and helped protect the real evil identities.",
            "Henry": "Henry\u2019s play came across as earnest and cooperative, and despite being on both a failing team and a later successful one, he didn\u2019t attract sustained suspicion, which suggests his table talk and voting were consistent with a good-aligned mindset.",
            "Iris": "Iris (Percival) played an active, vocal role and tried to interpret the Merlin/Morgana signals, but the mixed information and overlapping appearances on teams made it hard for her to lock in on the correct trusted core, especially in the late missions."

I could improve by more clearly steering suspicion away from Eve earlier, since she ended up taking the assassination, and by slightly tightening my early-game reactions so they look less like after-the-fact logic and more like natural deduction.",

I should have been more vocal about patterns in team overlap and more actively challenged the narrative that kept me on teams while evil stayed hidden. Next time I\u2019ll slow down approvals and argue more concretely from the mission history.",
          "player_observations": {
            "Bob": "As Merlin, Bob played very cautiously and avoided making overt pushes, which kept him safe but also left the good team without strong, directed suspicion on the right people. His subtlety made him look like a quiet generic good rather than a power role.",
            "Charlie": "Charlie as Mordred was convincing and calm, especially around Mission 3 where he managed to sit on a double-fail team without drawing overwhelming heat. He blended his accusations with just enough logic to appear like a frustrated good player.",
            "Diana": "Diana played in a straightforward, transparent way, which read as genuinely good and made her an anchor of trust later on. However, her reads didn\u2019t translate into strong table direction, so her influence on team selection felt limited.",
            "Eve": "Eve\u2019s inclusion on the first mission and the resulting fail put quiet suspicion on her, but she didn\u2019t over-defend herself, which actually made her look more towny over time. Her low-key style made it harder to confidently clear or condemn her.",
            "Frank": "Frank as Percival seemed genuinely uncertain between Merlin and the fake Merlin, which is understandable given how well evil obscured signals. He contributed reasonable logic but didn\u2019t strongly lock onto protecting the real Merlin in a visible way.",
            "Grace": "Grace as Morgana leaned into a somewhat analytical, confident style that made her a believable information role and a plausible Merlin candidate. Her presence on the failed first mission should have been more heavily scrutinized, but she deflected that suspicion effectively.",
            "Henry": "Henry as Assassin navigated early mission failures well, especially on Mission 2 where he managed to be on another single-fail team without getting immediately locked in as evil. He maintained a balanced tone\u2014just suspicious enough of others\u2014that gave him flexibility for endgame positioning.",
            "Iris": "Iris played like a solid good: measured, not overly dramatic, and generally consistent in her reasoning. Because she wasn\u2019t on the early failing teams, she naturally drifted into a more trustworthy spot, but she didn\u2019t quite manage to steer the table away from evil\u2019s narratives."

          "player_observations": {
            "Bob": "Played a very low-information assassin game, letting others drive the logic and blending into consensus, which made you harder to pin down until late. You avoided taking loud, risky stances that could have backfired in the assassin phase.",
            "Charlie": "You balanced revealing just enough correct suspicions to guide teams (especially Missions 4 and 5) while not appearing like an obvious information role. Your calm, reasoned tone and willingness to include contested players made you look like a solid generic good rather than Merlin.",
            "Diana": "You came across as a steady, low-drama good player, especially on the later successful teams. Your alignment with Charlie\u2019s reasoning without over-explaining helped reinforce trust in the final missions.",
            "Eve": "Your early presence on Mission 1 and later triple-fail Mission 3 created confusion while still leaving plausible deniability shared with others. You leaned into ambiguity well, using the chaos of Mission 3 to muddy clear evil identification rather than over-defending yourself.",
            "Frank": "You looked swingy mid-game after being on the failed Mission 2 but recovered trust by fitting cleanly into the later successful team structures. Your willingness to go on risky-looking teams made you appear more like a confused good than coordinated evil.",
            "Grace": "You set a very safe tone with the clean first mission, which gave you long-term credibility that paid off in Mission 5. Your choices tended to be conservative and synergy-seeking, helping stabilize the table when accusations got messy.",
            "Henry": "As Percival, you played a pretty subtle information game\u2014sometimes echoing Charlie, sometimes testing alternatives\u2014so you didn\u2019t telegraph your role. Your leadership on Mission 2 looked reasonable despite the fail, and you recovered well by ending up trusted on the later successful teams.",
            "Iris": "You leveraged the Mordred hidden-from-Merlin angle well by being active and central, especially on Mission 2 and the big fail on Mission 3. Your willingness to sit on key missions with mixed compositions increased distrust across the table and made it harder to isolate a clean evil cluster."

I did reasonably well at staying flexible after Mission 2\u2019s success, but I needed to push harder for smaller, more controlled teams and to question the repeat of the Mission 2 lineup on Mission 3 instead of accepting it too comfortably.",

I should have done more to sow doubt about Charlie specifically and better guide Henry\u2019s assassination away from Iris, especially in the later mission team discussions. Improving my late-game narrative and vote explanations could have made Merlin\u2019s identity less obvious.",

            "Charlie": "Was very effective as Merlin by being assertive without seeming forceful, especially around trusting Grace and subtly distrusting some early evil configurations. His reads felt \u2018reasonable\u2019 instead of magical, which let him survive to the assassination despite giving consistently strong guidance.",

            "Eve": "As Morgana, leaned into aggression on Mission 3 with the double-fail, which created a strong evil spike but also gave good players a clear place to focus their deductions. Her presence as my co-fail made it harder for us later to craft a believable story that split suspicion effectively.",
            "Frank": "Came across as analytically steady and fairly conservative with trust, which made his inclusion on multiple successful missions very reassuring to others. He didn\u2019t seem eager to push wild theories, and that grounded style reinforced his good image.",

            "Diana": "You were an effective Morgana, projecting just enough insight to plausibly be Merlin without over-claiming, which really pulled my attention away from Bob. Your steady presence on Missions 2 and 3 made you look like a core-good player and helped evil control the narrative.",
            "Eve": "You stayed relatively under the radar socially and let others drive the team discussions, which is strong assassin play because it preserved flexibility for the final kill. Your decisions around mission teams avoided drawing attention, making it difficult to pin you as evil until it was too late.",
            "Frank": "You took advantage of the early failing Mission 1 to muddy reads without over-explaining, which kept suspicion broadly distributed instead of focusing tightly on you. Your low-profile approach as Mordred blended well with the table and made you a persistent background threat.",
            "Grace": "You played like a straightforward good player, trusting early teams and not overcomplicating your logic, which made you feel honest but also somewhat influenceable. When missions started failing, you adapted, but you could have been more vocal about pushing safer, smaller cores.",
            "Henry": "You approached the game logically and tried to lean on mission results more than social reads, which is solid, but you sometimes gave too much benefit of the doubt to repeated team structures. Your generally calm demeanor helped you look good, but you might improve by more sharply questioning players who sat on multiple failing missions."

            "Grace": "Recovered from being on two early fail missions by anchoring the final mission with a clean team, and your willingness to repeat the successful Mission 4 composition reinforced a logical, good-aligned mindset.",
            "Henry": "As assassin, you leaned into the narrative that I was Merlin, which shows you tracked the information flow reasonably well, but you were maybe a bit too anchored on my Mission 2 leadership and didn\u2019t fully reassess Charlie\u2019s quieter but more accurate steering.",
