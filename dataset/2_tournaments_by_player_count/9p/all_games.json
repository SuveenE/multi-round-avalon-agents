Charlie and Frank were both on the failed mission 4, and Frank led that team, so I\u2019d rather not bring either of them when we have other viable options. Bob is the closest thing to a consensus anchor and has been on both successful missions, so I\u2019m including him. Alice\u2019s suggested structure (Bob + Alice + Grace + Henry + one of Eve/Frank) is consistent with excluding the main suspects and fits the mission history, and her perspective lines up well with treating Diana as the common spy, so I\u2019m following that frame and including Alice. Between Eve and Frank, I\u2019m choosing Eve because Frank both proposed and rode the last failed team, which is riskier than Eve\u2019s involvement in a single fail alongside Diana.

The main point of contention is the fourth slot: auto-locking Grace after just one clean appearance gives us little extra info and could let an unseen evil slip into later critical missions. With a 2\u20130 lead, we can afford to use this mission to both stay relatively safe and widen our info by rotating the fourth. Adding Alice instead of repeating Grace fits the majority preference at the table for testing a new fourth (Alice or Frank), keeps the proven core intact, and helps us distinguish later between Grace/Alice based on this mission\u2019s result, all while still fielding what is likely a very strong team.",

Among those, Alice/Charlie/Diana is the agreed core, and both Frank and Henry are cleared if Iris is the Mission 2 fail.

Bob and Eve are completely untested so far and have no direct linkage to any failed mission, making them our cleanest additions. Including myself (Grace) gives a lineup of: Alice (from the strong M2 success core and widely trusted), Bob (fresh, no fail history), Eve (fresh, no fail history), Grace (only linked to M1, where the more likely evil is in {Frank, Iris}), and Charlie (one representative from the M2/M3 group to avoid overstacking that suspect set while still gaining information). This team avoids the known risky M1 pair Frank/Iris, avoids double-stacking Diana and Henry from the M2/M3 block, and centers on the broadly preferred Alice/Bob/Eve core with just one additional suspect from that later mission cluster.",

Since I know I\u2019m good, that pins exactly one evil in {Alice, Charlie, Diana}. Separately, Mission 1 (Grace, Frank, Iris) had a single FAIL, so there is at least one evil in {Grace, Frank, Iris}. That gives us: 1 evil in {Alice, Charlie, Diana}, \u22651 in {Grace, Frank, Iris}, and the remaining evil(s) in {Bob, Eve, the rest of that M1 set}. To minimize overlap with the proven-contaminated M2/M3 core, I bench all of Alice, Charlie, and Diana. Among the M1 trio, I include Grace and Frank together and bench Iris, on the assumption there is at least one but not necessarily two evils there; taking two of them is a calculated risk, but it lets us avoid the guaranteed 1-in-3 evil from {Alice, Charlie, Diana}. I also add Bob and Eve as fresh, untested players outside both failed cores, plus myself as a known-good to me. Structurally, this team fully excludes the {Alice, Charlie, Diana} pool (where we know there is exactly one evil) and only lightly taps the M1 pool while adding two players (Bob, Eve) who have no direct failure association so far, which I judge to be the best balance of minimizing known risk while still having enough new information potential if something goes wrong.",

As Frank, I know I played success, so from my perspective the remaining possible evil in that subset is between Alice and Diana. Given Mission 1\u2019s fail implicates at least one of {Charlie, Henry, Grace}, and Grace is already heavily town-leaning from the above logic, that splash sits mostly on Charlie/Henry, so I prefer to keep both off this critical team. That leads to a core of Diana/Frank/Grace, which the table broadly supports, and we fill with the two players who have no direct mission-based suspicion so far: Bob and Iris.

Adding Diana fits that plan: she\u2019s also good at explaining her reasoning but isn\u2019t the center of all early proposals, which lets us compare how teams with and without Charlie perform later. This team balances talkative and quieter players, aligns with the stated table preferences, and avoids overloading the first mission with the heaviest influencers while still giving us useful behavioral info for future rotations.",
