Adding Diana fits that plan: she\u2019s also good at explaining her reasoning but isn\u2019t the center of all early proposals, which lets us compare how teams with and without Charlie perform later. This team balances talkative and quieter players, aligns with the stated table preferences, and avoids overloading the first mission with the heaviest influencers while still giving us useful behavioral info for future rotations.",

I could improve by appearing a bit more conflicted on key mission votes\u2014some of my approvals and rejections were too cleanly aligned with evil interests, which might be picked up by more attentive players in future games.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "You tended to play straightforwardly and trust early mission results heavily, which made you seem reliably good but also a bit influenceable by stronger table voices.",
        "Bob": "As Percival, you were very focused on role-reading and signal-tracking, but occasionally tunneled too hard on limited Merlin candidates rather than revisiting assumptions after later missions.",
        "Charlie": "You played a controlled, low-drama Assassin game, not drawing too much attention and blending into the mid-pack of suspicion, which helped preserve flexibility for the final kill.",
        "Diana": "You came across as cautious and somewhat quiet, usually following perceived consensus, which kept you safe from heavy suspicion but limited your impact on team selections.",
        "Eve": "As Merlin, you walked a careful line\u2014pushing the table in broadly correct directions without over-asserting, though at times your restraint made it possible for evil teams to slip through.",
        "Frank": "You were quite active in reasoning out team choices and mission implications, but sometimes shared your thoughts in a way that let evil subtly steer your logic rather than challenge it.",
        "Grace": "You played a logical and principled game, often trying to anchor discussion on mission data, but your openness and apparent reasonableness made you a convenient shield for evil-aligned proposals.",
        "Iris": "You leaned into a very low-profile Mordred style, staying just active enough to avoid looking checked out but not so prominent that people seriously revisited your alignment late game."

      "self_assessment": "I coordinated well with the other evil roles, especially by blending into the chaos around Missions 2\u20134 and not drawing extra suspicion after the double-fail on Mission 3. I could improve by more actively shaping town narratives earlier in the game instead of mostly reacting, particularly in pushing alternative Merlin candidates to protect Eve.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Played cautiously and projected a generally trustworthy vibe, which helped her get early team picks despite not strongly driving discussion.",
        "Bob": "Took on a clear info-gathering/coordination role as Percival, frequently referencing role reads and trying to protect Merlin, though occasionally tunneled too hard on a few suspects.",
        "Charlie": "As Assassin, stayed relatively low-key but opportunistic, stepping in more when it mattered and not overexposing themselves with loud accusations.",
        "Diana": "Played straightforward, logic-based good, tending to follow clearer voices rather than lead, which made her seem consistently but quietly trustworthy.",
        "Eve": "As Merlin, gave subtle but consistent steering on teams without being overly forceful, generally masking her extra information well until late game.",
        "Frank": "Showed a willingness to take risks with team compositions, which created useful information for good but also introduced ambiguity that evil could exploit.",
        "Grace": "Tried to be a stabilizing presence, focusing on reasoning through mission results and team histories, though sometimes got caught in analysis rather than pushing strong narratives.",
        "Henry": "As Morgana, did strong work muddying the Merlin/percival reads by being assertive and confident in table talk, drawing attention as a potential information role and helping keep Eve safer."
