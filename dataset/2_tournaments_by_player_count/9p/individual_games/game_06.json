        "Eve": "You came off as sincerely good and somewhat cautious, which made you a stabilizing presence but also meant you weren\u2019t aggressively driving the table\u2019s logic. Your voting felt principled, yet you didn\u2019t push hard enough to challenge the assumptions behind the early mission compositions.",
        "Frank": "As Percival, you seemed to be juggling conflicting Merlin signals and never fully committed to strongly town-reading Bob or distrusting Grace, which let evil hide in that confusion. Your table presence was thoughtful but a bit reactive, and a more decisive stance on the Merlin/Morgana read could have shifted how we built later teams.",
        "Grace": "You were an extremely convincing Morgana, projecting a calm, analytical tone that mimicked a careful Merlin and drew trust from several of us. Your willingness to be on the first failing mission without over-explaining it later helped maintain the illusion that you were just an unlucky but sincere good player.",
        "Henry": "As Assassin, you played assertively in leadership and didn\u2019t shy away from putting risky teams forward, which advanced evil\u2019s agenda while not looking overly opportunistic. Your confident posture after mission fails made it harder to pin you as the consistent common denominator behind bad outcomes.",
        "Iris": "You felt clearly good-leaning in discussion but didn\u2019t assert your reads strongly enough to influence the mission selection meta. Your willingness to go along with more dominant voices meant your good instincts had less impact than they could have if you\u2019d pushed your suspicions more forcefully."

I also didn\u2019t do enough to publicly structure the logic after Mission 2 and 3 fails, which let evil control the narrative; next time I\u2019ll speak up earlier with clearer reasoning and push for tighter, evidence-based team building.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Played in a straightforward, sincere way that made her seem generically good but not strongly cleared, which let evil hide behind her. She didn\u2019t overassert herself, so her presence on failed missions was easy to mentally handwave instead of properly analyzing.",
        "Bob": "As Merlin, he played cautiously and didn\u2019t hard-push specific suspects, which kept him safe but also left the good team without a strong, coordinated direction. His soft nudges were there, but subtle enough that they were easy to ignore in the chaos of repeated mission fails.",
        "Charlie": "Very composed and persuasive as Mordred, especially in Mission 3 where he anchored a disastrous team while sounding reasonable. He framed arguments in a calm, logical tone that made his proposals feel safe even when they clearly shouldn\u2019t have been after back-to-back fails.",
        "Diana": "Seemed quietly reasonable and not overly performative, which made her feel like a safe, low-drama pick. Because she didn\u2019t push sharp accusations, she faded into the background a bit and didn\u2019t strongly influence team direction for good or evil.",
        "Frank": "As Percival, he didn\u2019t clearly signal strong Merlin reads in a way that I could reliably follow, which made coordination between good power roles weaker. His play felt like standard good rather than a protective, guiding presence for Merlin\u2019s information.",
        "Grace": "As Morgana, she did a strong job blending in as a potentially insightful good player and used that to get on critical teams. Her social confidence helped normalize risky lineups, especially early, when we should have been much more skeptical after the first fail.",
        "Henry": "As Assassin, he played Mission 1 very smoothly and didn\u2019t attract the level of suspicion that a first-mission fail deserved. He managed to stay socially plausible across multiple fails, which means he balanced just enough talk to seem engaged without overexplaining.",
        "Iris": "Came across as genuinely good and somewhat trusting, which made her a useful barometer of where the general table sentiment was going. She didn\u2019t strongly drive team selection meta, but her agreement or hesitation subtly reinforced which narratives gained traction."

        "Alice": "Tended to trust early mission proposals and seemed relatively open to being led by stronger voices, which made her a good target for gentle steering. She didn\u2019t anchor hard on any single theory, which made her reads feel flexible but also a bit easier to nudge.",
        "Bob": "Played a controlled and cautious Merlin game, avoiding loud accusations and instead influencing teams more through voting and subtle comments. That low-profile style made it harder to pin him as Merlin, especially since he let other players take the visible leadership in discussion.",
        "Charlie": "Leaned into a proactive, confident leadership style that fit Mordred well, happily proposing risky teams like on Mission 3. That assertiveness absorbed a lot of suspicion, which was great cover for the rest of us on evil.",
        "Diana": "Came across as straightforward and earnest, generally approaching teams from a logical but not overly paranoid perspective. She seemed to value pattern-based reasoning over social reads, which made her slow to hard-clear or hard-condemn people.",

        "Frank": "As Percival, he appeared to be actively parsing the Merlin/Morgana signals and played with noticeable skepticism toward some team choices. His tendency to think aloud made him a key player to watch and subtly mislead, since his reads could influence others.",
        "Henry": "As Assassin, he was bold and willing to take blame for early mission outcomes, especially around Mission 1, which was very helpful for evil. His aggressive style helped shape the narrative of who was suspicious and kept good somewhat reactive.",
        "Iris": "Played a solid, steady good game, often aligning her votes with what seemed like the emerging table consensus rather than forcing her own agenda. That made her relatively hard to read but also less likely to derail evil\u2019s preferred team constructions."
