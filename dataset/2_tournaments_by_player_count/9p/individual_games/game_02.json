        "Bob": "Came across as steady and reliable, and his repeated inclusion on early mission teams built a lot of trust around him. He didn\u2019t overtalk, which made his presence on teams feel safe and uncontroversial.",
        "Charlie": "Played as a consistent, logic-driven voice who helped stabilize team discussions. Their calm reasoning style made them look reliably good and helped support the success of early missions without seeming flashy or Merlin-like.",
        "Diana": "Got positioned as a key core member of teams and looked quite trustworthy for most of the game. The failed mission with her on it created some ambiguity, but she still managed to avoid being a strong Merlin candidate in the end.",
        "Eve": "Did a strong job as Merlin by nudging team choices in the right direction without appearing too controlling. Her subtle influence didn\u2019t flag her as obviously special, which ultimately protected her from the assassin\u2019s guess.",
        "Grace": "Played a very perceptive, watchful game and often tracked mission compositions and voting patterns closely. As Percival, she seemed careful not to out her information too blatantly, which kept evil from easily identifying who she was.",
        "Henry": "Stayed relatively under the radar, which as Mordred is valuable since it limits Merlin\u2019s ability to call you out directly with confidence in social reads. Could potentially have applied more pressure in discussions to create confusion about where the evil team was located.",
        "Iris": "Took a more low-key good role, contributing enough to not look checked out but not dominating conversations. This quieter presence made it harder for evil to get clear reads or exploit her, and she fit into good teams without much objection."

      "self_assessment": "I correctly kept strong townreads on Bob, Charlie, and Diana through the game and treated Eve and (to a lesser extent) Diana as the likely Merlin/Morgana pair, which helped protect the real Merlin enough for the Assassin to miss. I could improve by being clearer and more vocal near the end about why I leaned Eve over Diana as Merlin, to better steer good players\u2019 perceptions without overexposing Merlin.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "You played fairly quietly but used Mission 3 to get a needed fail in a way that still left some ambiguity, which is solid Assassin play. However, your late-game Merlin read on Diana suggested you were perhaps overfocusing on mission leadership patterns rather than who subtly directed team selections.",
        "Bob": "You came across consistently village-aligned with steady, low-drama logic, which made it easy to trust you after the first successful mission. Your willingness to repeat cores and not overreact to the Mission 3 fail was very pro-good and helped stabilize team building.",
        "Charlie": "You felt methodical and open, often aligning with sensible team choices without pushing too hard to control outcomes, which made you a reliable anchor for good. Your calm reactions to mission results made you appear like a natural inclusion on most late teams.",
        "Diana": "You were very central to the game\u2014a frequent team pick and a plausible Merlin candidate\u2014yet you stayed just ambiguous enough that evil could credibly shoot you. Your response to the failed Mission 3 was measured and cooperative, which kept you trusted despite being on the failing team.",
        "Eve": "You played an excellent low-key Merlin game: your influence on team composition\u2014especially Mission 4\u2014felt gently guiding rather than forceful, which helped hide you. You let others front the loud logic while you nudged toward strong good cores, which clearly paid off when the Assassin missed.",
        "Frank": "Your presence felt more reactive than driving, which is a reasonable Morgana approach when Merlin isn\u2019t being obvious. You didn\u2019t manage to fully sell yourself as the competing Merlin candidate, though, which made it easier for me to narrow the Merlin/Morgana pair away from you.",
        "Henry": "You stayed in the shadows a bit too much for Mordred, which kept suspicion low but also limited your ability to meaningfully steer team choices. A bit more assertive but 'reasoned' disagreement on team compositions might have created more confusion among the good players.",
        "Iris": "Your playstyle felt cooperative and trusting, which supported the emerging good core without muddying the waters too much. Even though you weren\u2019t central to the critical missions, your lack of wild accusations helped maintain a calm environment that favored good\u2019s information use."

      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Played assassin cautiously and waited for more information rather than forcing an early narrative, but could refine endgame logic to weigh Eve\u2019s quiet influence more heavily.",
        "Bob": "Came across as consistently trustworthy and steady, contributing just enough reasoning without overexplaining, which helped him stay uncontroversial on multiple missions.",
        "Charlie": "Played a very cooperative, logic-forward style that made them a natural inclusion on teams and helped reinforce trust in the early successful missions.",
        "Diana": "Looked very mission-focused and straightforward, which made the failed Mission 3 an effective red herring that drew some late suspicion despite her generally clean image.",

      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Played a relatively low-key but well-timed evil game, taking her shot on Mission 3 in a way that didn\u2019t immediately clear or condemn any single player. Her assassin guess on Diana suggests she was misled by Eve\u2019s subtlety and perhaps overestimated how much Diana was steering the table.",
        "Bob": "Came off very reliably good, especially with the clean early missions that he was on, which anchored a lot of trust around him. His willingness to repeat similar cores on teams without overselling his reads made him look naturally towny rather than performative.",
        "Charlie": "Maintained a calm, collaborative presence and fit neatly into the \u2018trusted core\u2019 after consecutive successful missions. He seemed comfortable taking solid but not flashy positions, which made him feel like a stabilizer rather than someone trying to force outcomes.",
        "Diana": "Ended up in a suspicious spot after the failed Mission 3 but handled it with enough composure that the assassin still targeted her as Merlin. Her style drew some attention\u2014she looked thoughtful and engaged in team discussions, which made her a believable candidate for a power role.",
        "Eve": "Did an excellent job as Merlin, signaling suspicion on the right people without loudly hard-pushing them, which preserved her cover. Her ability to orchestrate or endorse the successful mission 4 team while not standing out too much was key to both the win and the assassin miss.",
        "Frank": "As Morgana, he kept a relatively low profile and didn\u2019t overclaim insight, which helped maintain ambiguity between him and Merlin. His subtle presence contributed to making the evil team composition less obvious even though they couldn\u2019t ultimately convert that into a correct assassination.",
        "Grace": "Played a solid Percival game by visibly engaging with the \u2018who\u2019s Merlin\u2019 puzzle but not outing her conclusions too directly. She followed Eve\u2019s lead in a way that supported good missions while still leaving enough uncertainty that evil couldn\u2019t be sure who the real Merlin was.",
        "Henry": "As Mordred, he stayed in the background enough that he never became a prime suspect or a clear towncore member, keeping him in a gray area. His conservative approach reduced immediate heat on him, but it also meant he didn\u2019t strongly shape mission teams in evil\u2019s favor."
