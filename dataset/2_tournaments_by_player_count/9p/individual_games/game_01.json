Charlie and Frank were both on the failed mission 4, and Frank led that team, so I\u2019d rather not bring either of them when we have other viable options. Bob is the closest thing to a consensus anchor and has been on both successful missions, so I\u2019m including him. Alice\u2019s suggested structure (Bob + Alice + Grace + Henry + one of Eve/Frank) is consistent with excluding the main suspects and fits the mission history, and her perspective lines up well with treating Diana as the common spy, so I\u2019m following that frame and including Alice. Between Eve and Frank, I\u2019m choosing Eve because Frank both proposed and rode the last failed team, which is riskier than Eve\u2019s involvement in a single fail alongside Diana. Rounding out with Henry and myself avoids stacking too many of the previously failing combinations together, while still staying close to the majority\u2019s preference for building around Bob and excluding Diana.",

Might strengthen future games by tracking voting patterns more aggressively and challenging suspicious team compositions earlier.",
