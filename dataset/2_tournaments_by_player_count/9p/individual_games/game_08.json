Grace is a relatively low-drama option who wasn\u2019t on M2 or M3 and only touched the M1 fail via association, so she\u2019s a good candidate to round out a mostly new mix. Overall this team: (1) double-benches the most contentious M3 pairings (Diana/Henry), (2) avoids the full M1 fail duo, and (3) centers the broadly supported Alice/Bob/Eve core while adding two comparatively less-suspected players for a cleaner, info-rich test.",

Since I know I\u2019m good, that pins exactly one evil in {Alice, Charlie, Diana}. Separately, Mission 1 (Grace, Frank, Iris) had a single FAIL, so there is at least one evil in {Grace, Frank, Iris}. That gives us: 1 evil in {Alice, Charlie, Diana}, \u22651 in {Grace, Frank, Iris}, and the remaining evil(s) in {Bob, Eve, the rest of that M1 set}. To minimize overlap with the proven-contaminated M2/M3 core, I bench all of Alice, Charlie, and Diana. Among the M1 trio, I include Grace and Frank together and bench Iris, on the assumption there is at least one but not necessarily two evils there; taking two of them is a calculated risk, but it lets us avoid the guaranteed 1-in-3 evil from {Alice, Charlie, Diana}. I also add Bob and Eve as fresh, untested players outside both failed cores, plus myself as a known-good to me. Structurally, this team fully excludes the {Alice, Charlie, Diana} pool (where we know there is exactly one evil) and only lightly taps the M1 pool while adding two players (Bob, Eve) who have no direct failure association so far, which I judge to be the best balance of minimizing known risk while still having enough new information potential if something goes wrong.",

        "Bob": "As Merlin, he was cautious rather than loud, nudging team compositions instead of hard-clearing or hard-accusing, which made him harder to nail down as a power role but also less influential on the mission outcomes.",
        "Charlie": "Showed a balanced, cooperative style\u2014asked the right questions and seemed to care about team structure\u2014but didn\u2019t leave very strong signature \u2018good\u2019 footprints, which made him blend into the middle of the pack.",
        "Diana": "As Morgana, she leaned into looking like a strong, info-driven good player, which helped create ambiguity for Percival and gave evil a credible voice when missions were being debated.",
        "Frank": "As Mordred, he was comfortable taking early risk (like going on the first mission) while not overtalking, which kept his alignment obscured and let others carry most of the social weight.",
        "Grace": "Her participation on the first failed mission made her a convenient suspicion sink; after that, she seemed somewhat reactive, defending herself more than driving new lines of inquiry.",
        "Henry": "Played a solid but somewhat understated good game, often following the emerging consensus rather than forcefully challenging team proposals, which reduced his impact on steering critical mission choices.",
        "Iris": "As Percival, she clearly tried to track Merlin vs. Morgana but didn\u2019t fully translate that into aggressive team curation; her leadership on Mission 4 showed some trust decisions that ultimately benefited evil."

      "self_assessment": "I blended in reasonably well as Mordred on the early missions, helping create just enough uncertainty around who was evil without drawing heavy suspicion onto myself. I could have coordinated more explicitly (through voting patterns and table talk) with Diana and Eve to shape a clearer narrative that framed specific good players, especially around the Mission 3 and 4 team selections.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Played straightforwardly and seemed to trust early mission structures, which made her look generally towny but also a bit influenceable in team selection dynamics.",

        "Charlie": "Approached team choices logically and appeared to rely heavily on mission outcomes and voting history, which made his reasoning transparent and relatively easy to anticipate.",
        "Diana": "Did a strong job as Morgana, projecting a confident good persona and helping create ambiguity around Merlin\u2019s identity through consistent, reasoned commentary.",
        "Eve": "Played a low-to-mid profile assassin game, not overreaching, which helped preserve flexibility for the endgame shot while still subtly amplifying doubts seeded by other evil players.",
        "Grace": "Came off as earnest and fairly trusting, which made her an appealing inclusion on teams and a useful barometer of how the more cautious good players were leaning.",
        "Henry": "Tended to be methodical and a bit conservative in team trust, focusing on previous mission results, which made him slow to fully pivot even when new information suggested alternative narratives.",
        "Iris": "As Percival, strongly engaged in reading Merlin signals and tried to guide team compositions accordingly, but the presence of Morgana clearly pulled her into some key misreads that helped evil succeed."

      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Played very straightforwardly and looked consistently good; being on multiple mixed teams without over-defending herself made it harder to find the real evil players around her.",
        "Bob": "Was cautious and low-key, which fits as Merlin, but the subtlety of his preferences and suspicions made it easy to miss his signals without actively tracking them.",
        "Charlie": "Came across as very reasonable and cooperative, which helped him seem reliably good and made his overlapping teams a useful but underutilized data point.",
        "Diana": "Blended in well as a core, trustworthy-looking player and repeatedly ended up on critical teams, using that central position to slip a fail into Mission 3 without drawing big blowback.",
        "Eve": "Stayed relatively under the radar while ending up on the final failing mission, capitalizing on others\u2019 perceived trust networks instead of loudly steering the table herself.",
        "Frank": "Got early trust from being on the first mission with only one fail and didn\u2019t attract enough follow-up suspicion, which let him fade into the background as an unexamined variable.",
        "Henry": "Felt like a generally solid, good-leaning voice whose presence on the mixed Mission 2/3 teams complicated reads but didn\u2019t make him stand out as strongly suspicious.",
        "Iris": "Acted like a central information-holding role, often trying to influence team comps; her trust choices (especially on the last mission) were pivotal but tough to decode from the outside."

        "Diana": "Blended very well as evil by sticking close to previously successful team compositions and only introducing a single fail at a time to avoid drawing attention.",
        "Eve": "Stayed in the background of team selection yet ended up on the critical failing mission 4, suggesting a low-profile, opportunistic evil style.",
        "Frank": "Got early access to mission 1, used the single fail to sow doubt without overexposing, and then stayed out of the spotlight afterward, which made him hard to pin down.",
        "Grace": "Her inclusion on the failed first mission made her look suspicious early, and she didn\u2019t have many later chances to clearly prove her loyalty.",
        "Iris": "As Percival, she seemed genuinely uncertain between Merlin and Morgana and allowed Diana to stay highly trusted, which was pivotal in giving evil repeated mission access."

      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "You consistently looked clean and played in a straightforward, transparent way, which made you an anchor for good teams but also a relatively easy player for evil to hide around. Your willingness to repeat mostly similar teams made it harder to break out of the frame evil had set.",
        "Bob": "You played a very subtle Merlin, often choosing not to hard-push your reads, which kept you alive but made it harder for me as Percival to distinguish you clearly from Morgana. Your low-key style worked well for survival, but it left your soft pushes a bit too ambiguous in the late game.",
        "Charlie": "You played very cautiously, rarely making bold accusations, which helped you seem reliably good but didn\u2019t generate much new information. Your alignment felt trustworthy, but you could have challenged team comps more aggressively, especially after the first fail.",
        "Diana": "You were an effective Morgana, projecting just enough insight to plausibly be Merlin without over-claiming, which really pulled my attention away from Bob. Your steady presence on Missions 2 and 3 made you look like a core-good player and helped evil control the narrative.",
        "Eve": "You stayed relatively under the radar socially and let others drive the team discussions, which is strong assassin play because it preserved flexibility for the final kill. Your decisions around mission teams avoided drawing attention, making it difficult to pin you as evil until it was too late.",
        "Frank": "You took advantage of the early failing Mission 1 to muddy reads without over-explaining, which kept suspicion broadly distributed instead of focusing tightly on you. Your low-profile approach as Mordred blended well with the table and made you a persistent background threat.",
        "Grace": "You played like a straightforward good player, trusting early teams and not overcomplicating your logic, which made you feel honest but also somewhat influenceable. When missions started failing, you adapted, but you could have been more vocal about pushing safer, smaller cores.",
        "Henry": "You approached the game logically and tried to lean on mission results more than social reads, which is solid, but you sometimes gave too much benefit of the doubt to repeated team structures. Your generally calm demeanor helped you look good, but you might improve by more sharply questioning players who sat on multiple failing missions."
