I also failed to give Iris (Percival) clear enough signals about who was likely Morgana versus Merlin, which made it easier for evil to control the narrative and ultimately for the Assassin to land the right shot.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Bob": "As Assassin, Bob managed to stay in enough successful-looking teams to appear plausible while still being on key failed missions, and he used that ambiguity well in the endgame to make a confident Merlin guess.",
        "Charlie": "Charlie played a very straightforward, good-leaning style, generally supporting what seemed like safe teams and not over-arguing, which made them look reliably good but also a bit passive in driving alternative team proposals.",
        "Diana": "Diana seemed engaged and thoughtful in team discussions, and her presence on the failed Mission 2 didn\u2019t draw as much heat as it could have, suggesting she was good at deflecting suspicion without over-defending herself.",
        "Eve": "Eve (Mordred) stayed impressively under the radar after the Mission 2 fail, managing to avoid becoming the focal point of suspicion even when logic could have pointed her way, which let evil preserve flexibility for later missions.",
        "Frank": "Frank showed a cautious, logic-driven approach, often aligning with what seemed like the consensus of reasonable teams, which helped him read as reliably good but may have limited how much he challenged deceptive narratives from evil.",
        "Grace": "Grace (Morgana) did a strong job of muddying the Merlin signal, presenting herself as someone with confident reads, which likely contributed to confusion for Percival and helped protect the real evil identities.",
        "Henry": "Henry\u2019s play came across as earnest and cooperative, and despite being on both a failing team and a later successful one, he didn\u2019t attract sustained suspicion, which suggests his table talk and voting were consistent with a good-aligned mindset.",
        "Iris": "Iris (Percival) played an active, vocal role and tried to interpret the Merlin/Morgana signals, but the mixed information and overlapping appearances on teams made it hard for her to lock in on the correct trusted core, especially in the late missions."

        "Iris": "As Percival, was clearly trying to identify Merlin but at times over-defended certain players, which inadvertently gave evil some clues about where the power roles were clustered."
