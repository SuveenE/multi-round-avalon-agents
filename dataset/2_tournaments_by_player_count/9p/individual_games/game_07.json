        "Charlie": "You balanced sharing useful suspicions with not over-directing the table, which helped you stay believable but not obvious as Merlin. Your leadership on Mission 4 and then Mission 5 (via influence and trust-building) steered us toward clean teams at crucial moments.",
        "Diana": "You played a solid, low-drama good game, backing successful teams in the late missions and not overcomplicating the table talk. Your inclusion on Missions 4 and 5 without causing suspicion reinforced you as a reliable, steady presence.",
        "Eve": "As Morgana, you leaned into being readable as a potential Merlin, especially around the chaotic Mission 3 fail, but your positioning didn\u2019t fully convince the assassin at the end. Your involvement in both a clean Mission 1 and the disastrous Mission 3 created a mixed record that helped evil for a while but also made you harder to fully clear.",
        "Frank": "You appeared reliable and cooperative, and your presence on the last two successful missions helped lock in a trustworthy core. Despite being on a failed Mission 2, you managed to keep suspicion relatively low by later aligning with good outcomes and consistent reasoning.",
        "Henry": "As Percival, you did a decent job not making Merlin too obvious, though your involvement in both a failed (Mission 2) and then successful late missions gave you a swingy profile. Your eventual alignment with the correct endgame teams suggested you were reading the Merlin/Morgana signals reasonably well by the end.",
        "Iris": "You played Mordred in a way that took advantage of the confusion around Mission 3, helping drive a strong multi-fail that really pressured the good team. However, the aggression of that triple-fail also created a big information spike that, in hindsight, made it easier for good to consolidate into safer teams in Missions 4 and 5."

I could improve by being more vocal and structured about my Percy reads earlier, especially after the single fail on Mission 2, and by challenging the logic behind the Mission 3 team a lot harder.",

        "Alice": "You projected a very townie, confident presence, and your Mission 4 team was clean and well-constructed, which made you look like a strong info hub (and thus a reasonable assassin target). You did a good job not overreacting to the Mission 2 fail even though you were on it.",
        "Bob": "You leaned into the chaos on Mission 3 in a way that created a lot of uncertainty and noise, which worked well for you as Assassin. Your social tone was aggressive enough to push suspicion elsewhere without overcommitting to any single narrative.",
        "Charlie": "You balanced giving direction with not overexposing yourself, especially by backing solid late-game teams without screaming \u2018Merlin\u2019. Your reads lined up cleanly with the final good team composition, which made your eventual survival over Alice impressive.",
        "Diana": "You played a low-drama, stabilizing good role, which helped make the late missions feel safer once you were included. Your willingness to go on back-to-back crucial missions without over-defending yourself made you read quite genuine.",
        "Eve": "You played a very convincing pseudo-good early on, especially being willing to go on the clean Mission 1 and then the doomed Mission 3, which muddied the waters a lot. Your partnership with Bob in sowing confusion was subtle rather than loud, which is strong for a hidden evil.",
        "Frank": "You came across as straightforward and pragmatic, especially on the clean Mission 4\u20135 teams, which helped solidify you as a reliable pick later. Your lack of theatrics made evil pushing on you difficult without looking forced.",
        "Grace": "Your Mission 1 leadership was quiet but effective, giving good an early success that felt natural rather than staged. Later, you played a more supporting, consensus-building role that helped lock in confidence on the final team rather than trying to re-open old debates.",
        "Iris": "You did a great job weaponizing the Mission 3 disaster to throw shade broadly, using your Mordred status to stay off Merlin\u2019s radar while still being central to the action. Your earlier willingness to be on mixed teams without looking overly nervous made you a persistent mid-spectrum read instead of an obvious suspect."

However, I should have done more to steer late-game team selections away from the all-good lineups in Missions 4 and 5, and I didn\u2019t contribute enough to helping Assassin triangulate Merlin correctly from the information we had.",

        "Charlie": "Masterfully low-key Merlin, guiding crucial team selections (especially Mission 4 and 5 compositions) without over-asserting, which kept suspicion off them until the endgame.",
        "Diana": "Played a steady, low-drama good game, blending into mid-table discussions and accepting good-leaning teams without causing unnecessary waves.",
        "Eve": "As Morgana, projected strong, confident opinions that helped create a Merlin/Morgana ambiguity, especially around Alice, but the coordination didn\u2019t quite translate into the final assassination.",

        "Grace": "Early leader who set a clean tone with a successful Mission 1 and then adopted a cautious but cooperative stance, contributing to good\u2019s ability to converge on trusted lineups by the end.",
        "Henry": "Played Percival with convincingly analytical reasoning, correctly trusting the right signals from Merlin over Morgana, which was key to locking in those final all-good mission teams."
