This team aligns with the emerging table consensus (multiple players explicitly endorsed Bob/Henry/Eve/Charlie) and provides strong information: if it passes, it strongly suggests the remaining evils are among {Alice, Grace} and {Diana, Frank, Iris}; if it fails, we can narrow suspicion to Bob/Charlie while having tested both new players at once.",

        "Charlie": "As Percival, he looked somewhat suspicious early because of Mission 1\u2019s fail and his proximity to evil, but he managed not to over-clear the wrong people. His midgame behavior made him a natural part of the good core once more information emerged.",
        "Diana": "Did a strong job as Morgana early, especially by getting onto a failing Mission 2 team in a way that didn\u2019t make her instantly obvious afterward. She projected a reasonably trustworthy tone that forced good to spend time untangling her alignment.",
        "Eve": "Played a very solid, calm good game, and her presence on the clean missions helped anchor trust in the final team compositions. She attracted the assassination shot, which means her table image was convincingly \u2018important good\u2019 without being too obviously non-Merlin.",
        "Frank": "As Mordred, he leveraged hidden information well by blending into team discussions and not being an obvious source of the early fails. Once the clean team pattern emerged, however, he couldn\u2019t reinsert himself without drawing suspicion.",
        "Grace": "As Assassin, she created early chaos with the Mission 1 fail while not becoming the primary focus of suspicion afterward. Her final shot on Eve showed she read the good core reasonably well but slightly misjudged who was quietly steering information.",

      "self_assessment": "I stayed reasonably consistent with a good-table image and didn\u2019t attract suspicion as Merlin, which helped keep heat off the real Merlin late game. I could improve by being more vocal in the early missions about structured reasoning and vote patterns, instead of mostly following others\u2019 logic, especially after the first two failed missions.",

        "Alice": "Played a very low-key, understated Merlin game\u2014her reads were subtly embedded in team preferences and votes rather than bold pushes, which kept suspicion off her even after the assassin shot elsewhere.",
        "Bob": "Maintained a very stable, good-lean presence and repeatedly ended up on successful teams, which built trust; he seemed to rely more on consistency and table image than explicit deduction.",
        "Charlie": "As Percival, he projected strong, confident reads and tried to shape team compositions aggressively, which made him look like a power role without overexposing Merlin.",
        "Diana": "As Morgana, she leaned into early mission involvement and tried to look like a confident information role, especially around Mission 2, but the single-fail pattern made her positioning increasingly awkward.",
        "Eve": "Came across as logical and steady, which made her a natural target for the assassin; her presence on multiple successful missions reinforced a \u2018likely Merlin or strong good\u2019 image.",
        "Frank": "As Mordred, he managed to get onto both a failed and a successful mission, blending into the mid-table and not over-pushing, which kept him from being the prime suspect later on.",
        "Grace": "As the assassin, she seemed to focus heavily on loud/central voices and late-game team influence, which led her to prioritize Eve over quieter but accurate players like Alice.",
        "Henry": "Played a very clean, trustworthy good game\u2014his late leadership on Missions 4 and 5 felt grounded in accumulated evidence, and he built consensus rather than forcing teams through."
