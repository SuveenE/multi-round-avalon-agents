As Frank, I know I played success, so from my perspective the remaining possible evil in that subset is between Alice and Diana. Given Mission 1\u2019s fail implicates at least one of {Charlie, Henry, Grace}, and Grace is already heavily town-leaning from the above logic, that splash sits mostly on Charlie/Henry, so I prefer to keep both off this critical team. That leads to a core of Diana/Frank/Grace, which the table broadly supports, and we fill with the two players who have no direct mission-based suspicion so far: Bob and Iris. This composition (Diana, Frank, Grace, Bob, Iris) avoids Alice, Eve, Charlie, and Henry\u2014the four with the heaviest mission-based suspicion\u2014while using the consensus D/F/G core and the least-tainted remaining pair.",

Her presence as my co-fail made it harder for us later to craft a believable story that split suspicion effectively.",
