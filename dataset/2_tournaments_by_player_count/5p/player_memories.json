I should have been more cautious about repeatedly including Eve and maybe added a bit more doubt or variation to protect her identity.

            "Charlie": "Showed patience and didn\u2019t need to force suspicion aggressively, which helped him gather enough information to make an accurate assassination. His social presence felt measured rather than loud, which likely made his final Merlin guess more believable and less questioned.",

However, her consistent inclusion on successful teams and the subtle trust she generated appear to have made her identity readable enough for the assassin to nail the final guess."

            "Charlie": "Came across as quietly logical and not overly forceful, which made him seem more trustworthy but also easier to sideline from key decisions. He didn\u2019t strongly leverage his good alignment to demand better teams, especially after Mission 3\u2019s fail.",

I should have argued more forcefully against including Charlie after the Mission 2 fail and against adding Eve to the otherwise clean pair in Mission 4. Next time, I\u2019ll be more vocal in connecting mission results to concrete team constraints so evil has less room to maneuver on the final mission.",

            "Bob": "Played like a cautious information-holder, often avoiding direct accusations, which fits Merlin but sometimes made it hard for the table to confidently follow his reads. His willingness to go on the final team with Charlie despite the prior failed mission with him suggests he prioritized subtlety over clearly steering good away from known risks.",
            "Charlie": "As assassin, he inserted himself into early teams and took a single, controlled fail that created lasting doubt without overexposing himself. He leaned on social persuasion to keep himself team-eligible late in the game, which paid off on the final mission.",
            "Diana": "Came across as consistently logical and was part of two clean missions, which fit her genuine good role. However, she still accepted a risky configuration on the last mission, suggesting she sometimes deferred too much to others\u2019 confidence instead of strictly trusting mission data.",
            "Eve": "Blended into the background of the discussion well enough that her inclusion on Mission 4 felt plausible rather than clearly dangerous. Her single, timely sabotage on that mission created confusion without making her look like the obvious evil choice afterward."

I could improve by seeding more plausible suspicion on myself as a regular good player, since my consistent presence on successful teams and resistance to some evil-leaning proposals probably contributed to Eve being a plausible Merlin candidate rather than fully muddying the waters.",

            "Bob": "Aggressive and opportunistic, willing to take the risky early fail on Mission 3 and then lean on social persuasion rather than mechanical safety. He seemed comfortable driving the narrative, which makes him dangerous in later games as either alignment.",
            "Charlie": "More low-key and reactive, blending into discussions instead of strongly leading them, which let him avoid heavy scrutiny even after Mission 4 failed under his leadership. This quieter approach works well for evil but may cause trust issues when he\u2019s actually good.",
            "Diana": "Played very straightforwardly, voting and speaking in ways that matched a typical cautious good player, which made it easier to trust her after the pattern of mission results emerged. She didn\u2019t push hard theories but supported reasonable teams reliably.",
            "Eve": "Appeared consistently logical and was often in the center of team discussions as an anchor of apparent reasonableness, which made her a natural Merlin suspect in the assassination phase. Her willingness to take leadership and accept responsibility for critical missions added to her perceived informational authority."

          "self_assessment": "I stayed under the radar well by joining two successful missions first, then contributing to well-timed fails on Missions 4 and 5 without drawing too much suspicion. I could improve by more actively steering suspicion toward a specific good player to create a clearer narrative, rather than relying mostly on quiet consistency and the chaos from late fails.",
          "player_observations": {
            "Alice": "As assassin, Alice took a more low-key approach, only directly sabotaging once and otherwise letting the table dynamics evolve, which helped keep evil\u2019s footprint small. Her willingness to fail the small Mission 3 with Diana was a strong pivot point that shifted the game\u2019s trust structure.",
            "Bob": "Bob played a very convincing Merlin by blending in as a generally logical good player rather than overtly steering teams, which reduced kill pressure on him. His inclusion on the final failing team suggests he was trusted broadly, indicating he managed his information reveals subtly.",
            "Charlie": "Charlie\u2019s playstyle seemed straightforward and principled, which made him look reliably good but not necessarily central to team-building decisions. His presence on the final mission without raising alarm suggests he didn\u2019t aggressively push theories, making him a relatively \u201csafe\u201d include for others.",
            "Diana": "Diana\u2019s repeated leadership and early mission success built a lot of table trust, which she used to form later mission teams that unfortunately included hidden evil. Her willingness to re-team with previous members (including me) showed a preference for consistency once she felt someone was cleared."

          "self_assessment": "I balanced early trust-building with well-timed sabotages, especially by leading safe-looking teams on Missions 1 and 3 before pushing the decisive fails on Missions 4 and 5. I could improve by creating more ambiguity around who the second evil player was, as the double-fail on Mission 5 may have narrowed suspicion onto a smaller subset of players.",
          "player_observations": {
            "Alice": "Alice played in a straightforward, consistently pro-mission way that made her look reliably good, which helped me hide behind her credibility on several teams.",
            "Bob": "Bob was patient with his assassin role, choosing spots to fail that didn\u2019t overexpose him early and coordinating the final double-fail effectively.",
            "Charlie": "Charlie played a cautious Merlin, steering teams away from stacked evil but doing so subtly enough that their soft pushes didn\u2019t immediately give away their identity.",
            "Diana": "Diana tended to follow table consensus and logic more than driving it, which made her look sincere but also slightly easier to sway regarding team approvals."

          "self_assessment": "I stayed reasonably inconspicuous as evil, letting missions pass without drawing suspicion, but I failed to read Merlin correctly and mis-assassinated Alice instead of Diana.
