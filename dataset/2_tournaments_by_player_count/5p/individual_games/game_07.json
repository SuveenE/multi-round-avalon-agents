        "Charlie": "More low-key and reactive, blending into discussions instead of strongly leading them, which let him avoid heavy scrutiny even after Mission 4 failed under his leadership. This quieter approach works well for evil but may cause trust issues when he\u2019s actually good.",
        "Diana": "Played very straightforwardly, voting and speaking in ways that matched a typical cautious good player, which made it easier to trust her after the pattern of mission results emerged. She didn\u2019t push hard theories but supported reasonable teams reliably.",
        "Eve": "Appeared consistently logical and was often in the center of team discussions as an anchor of apparent reasonableness, which made her a natural Merlin suspect in the assassination phase. Her willingness to take leadership and accept responsibility for critical missions added to her perceived informational authority."

However, I misread Merlin\u2019s signal density and over-weighted Eve\u2019s late-game confidence, causing a wrong assassination; I need to track early subtle guidance from Merlin more carefully and cross-check it against voting patterns instead of focusing so much on endgame table talk.",

        "Charlie": "Did solid, low-profile evil work by participating in the Mission 4 fail without making it feel like a huge information event, blending his voting and table talk well enough that suspicion stayed diffuse rather than focused on him.",
        "Diana": "Came across as naturally good by accepting some risk on teams and not forcing herself into every mission, which made her successful participation on Missions 1, 2, and 5 look like organic trust rather than coordinated signaling.",
        "Eve": "Showed confident leadership and table presence, especially as a frequent team member and final leader, which made her look like a likely information hub and drew my Merlin read; her assertiveness without being over-defensive was convincing enough to mislead my assassination."

However, I could have done more to subtly steer the assassin away from Eve and toward Alice by questioning Alice\u2019s accurate reads more aggressively and creating stronger, earlier narratives that painted her as cautious-good rather than secretly well-informed.",

Her team selections were quietly accurate, which in hindsight should have been a bigger red flag than Eve\u2019s more visible leadership.",
        "Bob": "As assassin, Bob committed to the Eve narrative, suggesting he was reading surface-level behavior and visible influence more than subtle information-control. He stayed reasonably low-key during missions but could be nudged in his suspicions, which made him somewhat steerable but also capable of locking into a wrong-but-confident guess.",
        "Diana": "Came across as straightforward and consistent, which made her look solidly good and not particularly controversial in team discussions. Her presence on both the early success and the failed Mission 3 created some ambiguity, but she didn\u2019t overdefend herself, which actually helped her credibility.",
        "Eve": "Eve\u2019s visible leadership and involvement in key missions made her an attractive candidate for the assassin, especially since she looked proactive and influential. She projected a confident, central-good vibe that unintentionally drew the night-kill attention away from the more subtly correct Merlin signals from Alice."

        "Bob": "Took advantage of his early trust from Mission 1 to later sneak in the fail on Mission 3, suggesting he\u2019s comfortable playing a longer con rather than being aggressively suspicious. His assassination on Eve shows he was fairly convinced by surface-level mission history and maybe underestimated how low-key Alice\u2019s Merlin game was.",
        "Charlie": "Stayed relatively under the radar and only directly contributed to a single failing mission on Team 4, which suggests a more passive evil style relying on others\u2019 social reads and confusion. He didn\u2019t strongly push misdirecting narratives, which made him less obviously evil but also less influential overall.",
        "Eve": "As a frequent team member and final mission leader, she projected a generally trustworthy, cooperative vibe and made solid team choices in Missions 1 and 5. The assassin\u2019s final guess on her as Merlin shows she appeared informed and confident enough in her reads that evil mistook her good play for a power role."
