I need to be more vocal about process-of-elimination logic and push harder on narrowing down the likely evils instead of staying relatively passive and trusting the wrong people.",

        "Charlie": "Took on leadership confidently and seemed to frame arguments logically, which made him feel trustworthy even when his mission failed and should have drawn more scrutiny.",
        "Diana": "Was assertive and comfortable being on multiple teams, and her calm reaction to mission fails helped her blend in and avoid being singled out as the source of sabotage.",

I could improve by more actively shaping team compositions and table talk to frame specific good players (especially Eve) as suspicious or as potential Merlin, rather than just blending in.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Tended to accept being placed on teams and played in a straightforward, trusting way, which made her seem reliably good but not especially vocal in pushing accusations.",

        "Diana": "Played aggressively and was willing to fail missions at key moments, leaning into the assassin role with bold moves that created chaos and doubt among the good players.",
        "Eve": "Tried to guide team selection subtly rather than forcefully, which kept her alive and less obvious as Merlin but also meant her influence wasn\u2019t strong enough to prevent repeated bad team choices."

      "self_assessment": "I did well at staying engaged in team discussions and trying to build consistent reasoning from one mission to the next. However, I tunneled too hard on trusting Diana after Mission 1 and didn't adjust quickly enough when patterns started pointing to her as the common denominator on failing teams. In the future, I should be more willing to reevaluate my assumptions after each mission result, especially when the same player appears repeatedly on failed missions.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Played as a steady, straightforward good player, consistently willing to go on missions and seemed genuinely frustrated by the fails, which in hindsight fit her being good. She didn\u2019t over-push accusations, which made her easier for evil to frame as suspicious when multiple failed missions included her.",
        "Bob": "Kept a relatively low profile and avoided being on too many early teams, which helped him dodge suspicion for a long time. His inclusion on the failing Mission 3 team felt like a one-off at the time, but in hindsight that quiet, conservative approach worked very well for an evil player.",
        "Diana": "Very effective as assassin, projecting reliability early by being on the successful first mission and then leveraging that trust to get repeatedly onto later teams. Her confident team proposals and willingness to go on risky missions made her look like a proactive good player, which I bought into for too long.",
        "Eve": "Played quite subtly for Merlin, not over-directing the table or making aggressive calls, which helped avoid drawing a clear target on themselves. Their late-game positioning on my Mission 4 team suggests they were trying to nudge good toward a better combination without revealing too much, but my misreads on Diana undercut that help."
