Diana\u2019s only mark is that she shared the failed team with Bob.

However, I relied too much on repeated team structures without systematically testing suspects, so I didn\u2019t narrow down the evil players fast enough and let them blend into successful missions.",

        "Bob": "Played very cautiously and avoided drawing too much suspicion, managing to be on both successful and failed missions without standing out as the likely source of the fail.",
        "Charlie": "Felt relatively low-key and analytical, not pushing too hard but subtly steering choices in ways that in hindsight were often correct for good.",
        "Diana": "Seemed earnest and straightforward, and her mission leadership didn\u2019t strongly clear or condemn anyone, which made it hard to use her teams as solid alignment indicators.",
        "Eve": "Played an assertive and central role in team formation, projecting confidence and using early mission successes to build trust that later allowed her to slip fails through."

      "self_assessment": "I stayed consistently credible as a likely good player, especially by choosing a clean team on Mission 3 and sharing suspicion with Eve in a way that didn\u2019t expose us together. I could improve by more actively shaping the table\u2019s read on Charlie earlier, as he flew under the radar enough that I never fully locked in a Merlin read during play.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Played very proactively and often put herself on teams, which made her look confident and \u2018central\u2019 to the game state but also kept her under constant scrutiny. Tended to argue from logic and mission structure rather than gut reads, which made her look more village-aligned even when she was occasionally wrong.",
        "Charlie": "Kept a relatively low profile but contributed just enough analysis to seem helpful without over-directing the table, a classic subtle Merlin pattern. His suspicions were generally accurate but delivered gently, often as questions or soft nudges rather than hard pushes.",
        "Diana": "Played cautiously and seemed to rely heavily on mission outcomes and consensus rather than pushing strong original theories. Her team proposals and reactions felt sincere but somewhat reactive, making her read as clearly good but not especially influential.",
        "Eve": "Balanced risk and subtlety well: she took and passed Mission 1 to build trust, then later positioned herself flexibly on critical teams without drawing obvious \u2018evil coordinator\u2019 heat. Her willingness to go on multiple key missions while varying overt confidence helped her look like a bold good player instead of a scheming evil one."

      "self_assessment": "I correctly identified both evil players fairly early, but I struggled to signal that information clearly enough without exposing myself as Merlin. I need to improve at subtly steering team selections and mission votes so that good players have more confidence in the right reads, while still leaving enough ambiguity to avoid an easy assassin shot.",

        "Alice": "Very willing to go on missions and took leadership proactively, which made her look slightly suspicious after Mission 2 but ultimately consistent and transparent in discussion.",
        "Bob": "Played a convincing, measured game as assassin, mixing cooperation and a single fail early to build trust and then coordinating the decisive double-fail on Mission 5.",
        "Diana": "Approached the game cautiously and seemed to rely heavily on mission results over social reads, which made her slower to pivot away from early assumptions.",
        "Eve": "Played aggressively and kept herself central to team compositions, managing to appear just plausible enough as good despite being on two failing missions, which created confusion and doubt among the good players."

      "self_assessment": "I stayed reasonably consistent in trusting Alice, which was correct, but I didn\u2019t push hard enough to clear Charlie as likely Merlin and protect him more clearly going into the endgame. On my own mission as leader, I picked a risky team including Eve without demanding stronger justification, which gave evil a crucial fail and signaled that my reads weren\u2019t solid. I need to be more vocal about my suspicions earlier and anchor my decisions more on mission results and voting patterns instead of social impressions.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Played a very steady, low-flash good game; she was often on correct teams but didn\u2019t over-assert herself, which made her look reliably but not obviously good. Her willingness to go on multiple early teams without loud resistance made her a natural hub for both good and evil players to cluster around.",
        "Bob": "Blended in well by accepting some good-looking team compositions while slipping in subtle sabotage at key points, especially on Missions 2 and 5. His playstyle leaned on being flexible with his approvals/denials so his voting record didn\u2019t clearly out him as evil until it was too late.",
        "Charlie": "Gave just enough quiet directional nudges to good-leaning teams without hard-clearing anyone, which is strong Merlin play but also made it harder for us to rally around him as clearly good. His understated influence helped guide some good decisions, but the subtlety also kept us from fully capitalizing on his information.",
        "Eve": "Leveraged an early clean mission (Mission 1) to establish a strong trust base and repeatedly positioned herself on teams that looked reasonable from the outside. She played assertively as leader, especially on Missions 1 and 5, using confident team proposals to make her inclusion feel natural rather than suspicious."
