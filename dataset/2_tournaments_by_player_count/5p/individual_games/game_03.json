        "Charlie": "Came across as quietly logical and not overly forceful, which made him seem more trustworthy but also easier to sideline from key decisions. He didn\u2019t strongly leverage his good alignment to demand better teams, especially after Mission 3\u2019s fail.",
        "Diana": "Blended in well as leader on Mission 1 with a clean success, which gave her lingering credibility. She played assertively but not aggressively, and managed to stay on multiple teams without drawing enough heat even after suspicious results.",
        "Eve": "Used Mission 2 effectively to create ambiguity, keeping suspicion spread out rather than focused on herself. She was comfortable taking leadership on Missions 2 and 4 and proposing mixed teams that always had at least one evil, while framing them as reasonable compromises."

I did reasonably well at staying calm and not overreacting to early fails, but I need to be more vocal about patterns across missions and more willing to challenge 'convenient' narratives that let certain players skate by.",

        "Charlie": "Charlie played a straightforward, transparent style and seemed genuinely confused by the midgame logic knots, which made him read consistently good but also meant he didn\u2019t exert strong influence over the critical team decisions.",
        "Diana": "Diana balanced trust-building and targeted sabotage well; she got onto key teams without drawing much suspicion and her accusations felt calm and measured, which helped her pass as good long enough for evil to secure crucial mission fails.",
        "Eve": "Eve leaned into being active and involved in team discussions, using that visibility to appear helpful while subtly steering lineups toward at least one evil player; her early willingness to sit with partial suspicion but not overdefend herself made her harder to pin down."

However, I clearly misread Diana and didn\u2019t press hard enough on the implications of Mission 2\u2019s fail, which let evil stay comfortably hidden and led me to propose a losing team.",

        "Eve": "Positioned herself as a \u2018reasonable skeptic\u2019 after the Mission 2 fail, directing suspicion outward without being too defensive, and used leadership opportunities to construct teams that subtly protected fellow evil."

      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Very composed and willing to go on multiple teams, which made her look reliably good\u2014but her presence on almost every key team was a subtle Merlin tell. She managed information carefully rather than loudly, suggesting she prefers quiet influence over overt table control.",
        "Bob": "Played fairly straightforwardly good, going on multiple teams and not overasserting accusations, which made him a solid 'default trust' candidate. He seemed to follow the social consensus more than drive it, which can make him harder to read but also less dangerous as Merlin.",
        "Charlie": "His leadership on Mission 3 and willingness to take a small team with me suggested he was trying to be logical and risk-aware, which read very village-leaning. He didn\u2019t strongly push any radical theories, so his playstyle comes off as methodical but not highly deceptive.",
        "Eve": "Handled the evil role well by taking a pivotal leadership position twice and spreading the fails across different missions to avoid a clear pattern. Her team selections and participation created just enough ambiguity around where the evil players were, which gave me room to stay relatively under the radar as assassin."

        "Bob": "He tended to follow the emerging table consensus and was relatively quiet in pushing his own theories, making him appear generally trustworthy but also easier to mislead with confident claims from others.",
        "Charlie": "He played straightforwardly and placed a lot of weight on mission results over social reads, which made him predictable in his team preferences and somewhat easier to manipulate by shaping which missions succeeded or failed.",
        "Diana": "As Assassin, she blended in well with the good team\u2019s reasoning and didn\u2019t over-defend suspicious players, which helped preserve her cover; at times she could have been even more assertive in seeding alternative suspects to pull attention away from the actual Merlin."
