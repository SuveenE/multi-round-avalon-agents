The two failed missions were: Mission 2 (Alice, Bob, Charlie) and Mission 4 (Alice, Diana, Eve). From this, the only impossible evil pair is (Bob, Charlie), because if they were both evil, Mission 4 could not have failed (neither Bob nor Charlie were on it). So Bob and Charlie cannot both be evil. Any valid evil pair that fits the mission results is among {Alice, Bob, Charlie, Eve}, and for every such pair, the team Bob\u2013Charlie\u2013Diana contains at most one evil player: - If Alice is evil with Bob, only Bob is evil on this team. - If Alice is evil with Charlie, only Charlie is evil on this team. - If Alice is evil with Eve, then Bob and Charlie are both good and this team is entirely good. - If Bob is evil with Eve, only Bob is evil on this team. - If Charlie is evil with Eve, only Charlie is evil on this team. In contrast, teams that include Alice or Eve can, under plausible pairings, contain both evil players (for example, Alice\u2013Bob\u2013Diana if Alice and Bob are evil, or Bob\u2013Diana\u2013Eve if Bob and Eve are evil). Given Alice is the only constant on both failing missions, excluding her reduces risk further. Therefore, Bob\u2013Charlie\u2013Diana is the composition that best fits the mission history and structurally avoids ever putting two confirmed-possible partners together, giving us the highest chance of a clean final mission.",
