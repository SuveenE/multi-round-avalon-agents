Bob\u2019s suggested team explicitly keeps me on and avoids Alice, which is consistent with my perspective. Charlie and Eve both proposed excluding me entirely, despite my being on two successful missions, which is more suspicious from my vantage point.

However, I failed to communicate my reads in a way that clearly protected me from being identified as Merlin and also didn\u2019t push hard enough to keep Eve off the final mission, which ultimately let evil win. Next time I should shape my voting and table talk to be more subtly persuasive while also looking more plausibly confused.",

Your ability to stay on teams without drawing overwhelming backlash shows you manage social perception effectively.",
        "Charlie": "You played cautiously and didn\u2019t force your views too hard, which made you look consistently good but also meant your information didn\u2019t drive team selection as much as it could have. Your quieter style is trustworthy, but you could sometimes benefit from pushing your reads more clearly, especially near the final mission.",
        "Diana": "You projected a very trustworthy, proactive good presence, especially with your early mission leadership and team choices that generally helped good. Even after being on failing teams later, you maintained credibility, which suggests your table talk and demeanor are naturally convincing.",
        "Eve": "You blended in well as a flexible team member, getting onto multiple critical missions while avoiding becoming the primary suspect until quite late. Your ability to sit on both a clean second mission and later failing missions without being locked out shows you\u2019re good at managing suspicion and adapting your story as the game evolves."

Her fail on Mission 3 was well-timed, creating ambiguity between her and me without overexposing herself.",
        "Bob": "As Merlin, he steered teams toward mostly safe configurations early (especially Mission 1 and avoiding suspicious mixes) but was cautious enough not to hard-clear or hard-accuse, which kept him alive until the end. His influence on the final team composition was strong but not transparent, which is solid Merlin play even though good ultimately lost.",
        "Charlie": "Played a very straightforward, good-leaning style and seemed to base decisions mostly on mission results rather than deeper vote-analysis or role inference. This made him look reliably good but also fairly easy to sway, especially going into the final mission where he accepted a team that still had hidden evil.",
        "Eve": "Blended in extremely well as evil by taking leadership on Missions 2 and 5 and proposing teams that looked reasonable given past successes, especially Mission 2\u2019s clean result to earn long-term trust. Her choice of the final team (Alice, Bob, Charlie) was subtle enough that it didn\u2019t immediately scream \u2018stacked evil,\u2019 which helped secure the last fail."

I could improve by more actively steering suspicion toward a specific good player to create a clearer narrative, rather than relying mostly on quiet consistency and the chaos from late fails.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "As assassin, Alice took a more low-key approach, only directly sabotaging once and otherwise letting the table dynamics evolve, which helped keep evil\u2019s footprint small. Her willingness to fail the small Mission 3 with Diana was a strong pivot point that shifted the game\u2019s trust structure.",
        "Bob": "Bob played a very convincing Merlin by blending in as a generally logical good player rather than overtly steering teams, which reduced kill pressure on him. His inclusion on the final failing team suggests he was trusted broadly, indicating he managed his information reveals subtly.",
        "Charlie": "Charlie\u2019s playstyle seemed straightforward and principled, which made him look reliably good but not necessarily central to team-building decisions. His presence on the final mission without raising alarm suggests he didn\u2019t aggressively push theories, making him a relatively \u201csafe\u201d include for others.",
        "Diana": "Diana\u2019s repeated leadership and early mission success built a lot of table trust, which she used to form later mission teams that unfortunately included hidden evil. Her willingness to re-team with previous members (including me) showed a preference for consistency once she felt someone was cleared."
