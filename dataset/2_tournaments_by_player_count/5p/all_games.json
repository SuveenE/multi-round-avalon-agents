That means the two evils are Bob and exactly one of {Charlie, Diana}, and Eve is guaranteed good. Any team of {Charlie, Diana, Eve} is therefore guaranteed to include exactly one evil (since Bob is out and the other evil is in C/D), so Diana\u2019s preferred team (Charlie, Diana, Eve) is a guaranteed fail and strongly suggests she is the remaining evil with Bob.

That pattern most naturally points to the Mission 2 fail coming from Charlie and the Mission 4 fail coming from Eve, making {Bob, Diana} the most reliable partners. Additionally, the push from Charlie, Diana, and Eve as a bloc to exclude me entirely and back a Bob\u2013Charlie\u2013Diana team is exactly what evil would want if I\u2019m actually good and a consistent presence on teams; from my seat, that coordinated skepticism increases the odds that at least one of Charlie or Eve is evil. Given the need to maximize our success odds on the final mission, Alice\u2013Bob\u2013Diana is the lowest-risk trio based on mission results and voting behavior so far.",

In contrast, teams that include Alice or Eve can, under plausible pairings, contain both evil players (for example, Alice\u2013Bob\u2013Diana if Alice and Bob are evil, or Bob\u2013Diana\u2013Eve if Bob and Eve are evil). Given Alice is the only constant on both failing missions, excluding her reduces risk further.

Mission 3\u2019s single FAIL constrains the evils to exactly one of {Alice, Diana} and one of {Bob, Eve}, with me (Charlie) confirmed good to myself. To have any chance at a fully good team, we must take exactly one from {Alice, Diana} and one from {Bob, Eve}; picking both from a pair (e.g., Alice+Diana or Bob+Eve) guarantees including an evil. Between Alice and Diana, the failed Mission 3 when Alice joined Diana makes Alice more suspicious, since Diana has been on two successful missions already. Between Bob and Eve, Eve has already been part of a successful 3-person mission including me. So the highest-probability good team, consistent with prior mission results, is to reuse the proven-successful Mission 2 lineup: Charlie, Diana, and Eve.",

Both Missions 1 (Diana, Bob) and 2 (Diana, Charlie, Eve) were clean, so any of Bob/Charlie/Eve could have chosen to pass earlier as the second evil. I therefore want to (1) hard-exclude Alice, and (2) favor players who are treating me as likely good rather than trying to push me off teams. Bob\u2019s suggested team explicitly keeps me on and avoids Alice, which is consistent with my perspective. Charlie and Eve both proposed excluding me entirely, despite my being on two successful missions, which is more suspicious from my vantage point. Between Charlie and Eve, Charlie\u2019s justification (claiming only Mission 2 is safe yet then pulling in Bob) felt less internally consistent, so I slightly prefer Eve over Charlie. As a result, the best team I can propose is myself, Bob, and Eve \u2013 it guarantees Alice is off the critical mission while leaning on players whose logic has been more aligned with my known-good perspective.",
