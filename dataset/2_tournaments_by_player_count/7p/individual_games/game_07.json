        "Bob": "Played a cautious Merlin, often positioning himself on early teams and pushing subtly rather than hard-accusing, which helped him avoid looking too obviously informed. However, his consistent inclusion on successful/\u2018safe\u2019-seeming teams eventually made him look central to good coordination.",
        "Charlie": "Acted like a protective Percival, frequently aligning with Bob and soft-defending him, which signaled that he likely saw Bob as a power role. His attempts to steer suspicion toward others were measured but a bit transparent once fails started clustering away from Bob.",
        "Diana": "As Morgana, she leaned into being an assertive voice, offering confident reads that made her look like a strong good player. Her presence on the double-fail mission was risky but her prior social capital helped blunt the suspicion that should have landed on her more heavily.",
        "Eve": "Played Mordred as a flexible saboteur, willing to be on both risky and safe-looking teams and timing her visible opposition carefully. She contributed to mission fails without becoming the primary scapegoat, which helped maintain uncertainty about where evil was centered.",
        "Frank": "As good, he seemed genuinely uncertain and followed table consensus more than driving it, which made him look honest but also somewhat manipulable. His early inclusion on teams and lack of strong resistance to evil narratives helped those missions go the way evil wanted.",
        "Grace": "Adopted a more analytical but slightly reactive good playstyle, often voicing concerns after key mission outcomes rather than pre-emptively. Her suspicion tended to scatter, which relieved pressure on the actual evil players and limited good\u2019s ability to consolidate a clear narrative."

I also failed to clearly and consistently steer teams away from the Diana/Eve combination without looking like I had extra info, which let evil stack Mission 3 and set up the loss on Mission 4.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "You played Oberon very quietly and stayed under the radar; your lack of strong agenda made you look like a slightly disengaged good player rather than hidden evil. Because you weren\u2019t pushing hard on team compositions, you never drew the kind of suspicion that usually hits evil early.",
        "Charlie": "As Percival, you were actively trying to solve the Merlin/Morgana puzzle, but your reads on Diana vs. me seemed to drift toward trusting Diana too much. Your willingness to back risky teams made it easier for evil to pass questionable lineups without heavy scrutiny.",
        "Diana": "Your Morgana play was strong: you inserted yourself into key teams and blended confident table talk with just enough logic to seem like a good strategist. The double-fail on Mission 3 was set up well by your earlier reasonable behavior, so when it finally blew up, suspicion spread wide instead of landing squarely on you.",
        "Eve": "You played Mordred as a flexible support evil, often taking moderate, non-flashy positions that kept you from being the obvious suspect. Your inclusion on the Mission 2 fail was subtle enough that it looked like it could easily have been Frank or even me misjudging, which gave you long-term cover.",
        "Frank": "You played like a very straightforward good player, backing teams that made intuitive sense rather than over-the-top \u2018safe\u2019 ones, which accidentally gave evil more room on Missions 2 and 4. Your clean behavior on Mission 1 helped you look trustworthy, but also made your later approvals more influential in pushing through a bad team.",
        "Grace": "You were relatively cautious and tried to avoid loudly anchoring on hard reads, which kept you looking consistently good but also limited your ability to stop bad teams. Your tendency to follow the table\u2019s momentum rather than drive it meant that once the discussion leaned toward trusting the wrong people, you went along instead of pushing back."

        "Bob": "Played a very cautious and non-accusatory Merlin, often preferring to hint through team preferences rather than hard pushes, which made it tougher for good to fully lock onto his information but also kept him relatively safe.",
        "Diana": "Played an assertive, persuasive style as Morgana, confidently volunteering for teams and framing her presence as \u2018stabilizing,\u2019 which helped mask her after the double-fail on mission 3 by shifting blame onto team construction logic.",
        "Eve": "Adopted a flexible, adaptable approach\u2014willing to be on early missions and then subtly leaning into doubt once mission 2 failed, using that single fail to seed plausible narratives without becoming the loudest voice.",
        "Frank": "Came across as earnest and straightforward, but his early willingness to team with Eve and then later to accept riskier team compositions made it easier for evil to slip onto missions without heavy resistance.",
        "Grace": "Played a more analytical but somewhat reactive game, often commenting on the logic of past missions rather than forcefully proposing alternative teams, which meant her good instincts had less impact on actual team selections."

        "Frank": "Your play felt very transparently good-aligned\u2014especially your participation on Mission 1 and your later reasoning\u2014which made you a stabilizing voice but also somewhat predictable for evil to work around.",

His restraint in calling people out too directly helped him stay alive but also left some ambiguity that we exploited.",

        "Diana": "Diana played aggressively and embraced risk, pushing teams that mixed alignments and using the double-fail Mission 3 to sow maximum confusion. Her style as Morgana sold a strong \u2018possible Merlin\u2019 aura, which helped divert attention away from Bob at key moments.",
        "Frank": "Frank\u2019s early success on Mission 1 gave him some credibility, but later participation on mixed teams made him second-guess his reads and hesitate on hard accusations. He seemed to rely more on mission outcomes than on social reads, which made him vulnerable to manipulated team compositions.",
        "Grace": "Grace approached the game cautiously and seemed to look for consensus before committing to strong stances, which made her appear reasonable but not particularly leading. That hesitancy meant her suspicions didn\u2019t significantly shift the group\u2019s direction even when she was on the right track."

        "Charlie": "Came across as sincerely analytical and very \u2018good-coded\u2019, which fits Percival, but you could have done more to openly challenge the inclusion of Eve and Diana after multiple fails; your reads seemed close but not forcefully pushed.",
