        "Alice": "Tended to end up on early successful teams, which made her look very clean and a natural target for the Assassin\u2019s Merlin guess; her play came across as steady and non-flashy.",
        "Bob": "Played Merlin very subtly, only appearing on safe teams and not drawing much attention, which clearly worked since the Assassin guessed wrong; his influence on team selection felt quiet but accurate.",
        "Charlie": "As an early leader, he formed a clean Mission 1 team, suggesting solid initial instincts; his playstyle felt proactive but not overbearing, fitting well with a loyal support/reading role as Percival.",
        "Eve": "Never appearing on a mission kept mechanical suspicion low but forced her to rely purely on table talk to misdirect; her impact likely came more from narrative shaping than from mission results.",
        "Frank": "Joining Mission 3 and causing the lone fail points to a calculated willingness to strike only when it mattered; his earlier absence from missions helped him stay under the radar until that point.",
        "Grace": "As Oberon, she stayed completely off all missions and thus never had to reveal alignment through cards, which fit a very low-profile, information-denying style that made her hard for good to read at all."

      "self_assessment": "I coordinated reasonably well with the evil team by letting early missions pass, which helped build trust around Alice and Diana, but I failed to create enough Merlin-like signals to pull Percival fully off of Bob. I also should have pushed harder on alternative Merlin candidates after Mission 3, and my endgame reads and influence on the assassin guess were too weak.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Played very clean and consistent, building strong early trust by being on multiple successful missions and not over-explaining her reasoning. Her quiet reliability made her look generically good rather than particularly Merlin-y, which helped her survive to the endgame.",
        "Bob": "Managed information subtly, giving just enough correct nudges on team selection to look competent without appearing too omniscient. His ability to stay relatively low-key while still guiding key decisions made him a very effective, well-hidden Merlin.",
        "Charlie": "Took an active, somewhat probing approach as leader, asking questions and trying to form clear logic chains, which fit well with a cautious good role. As Percival, he seemed to track multiple Merlin candidates but didn\u2019t hard-clear anyone publicly, which kept the board state ambiguous for evil.",
        "Diana": "Came across as very trustworthy by staying calm and consistent across missions, especially as part of multiple successful teams. Her reasoning felt sincere rather than performative, which made her a natural anchor for good teams.",
        "Frank": "As Mordred, he took the key risk of failing Mission 3, which created needed suspicion but didn\u2019t fully shift the narrative away from the core trusted group. He stayed just suspicious enough to be a plausible evil without drawing overwhelming heat, but couldn\u2019t convert that into a misdirected endgame.",
        "Grace": "Played more independently and slightly off-tempo from the rest of the table, which fit the Oberon role but made coordination with the rest of evil harder. Her unclear alignment to both sides introduced some noise, but it didn\u2019t translate into enough confusion to disrupt good\u2019s emerging consensus."

      "self_assessment": "I coordinated the Mission 3 fail in a way that didn't immediately expose me, but I failed to push enough suspicion away from Bob and instead let the table settle into a comfortable, incorrect narrative about Merlin. I also didn't do enough active agenda-setting in discussions, which meant good players controlled the framing and I ended up with a bad assassination guess on Alice instead of seriously challenging Bob\u2019s growing credibility.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Consistently willing to be on early teams and played in a very low-key, cooperative way, which made her look generically villagey without drawing much attention. Her quiet reliability helped good secure early successes and made it tempting to mis-assassinate her as Merlin.",
        "Bob": "Managed information and tone extremely well, rarely overclaiming and instead nudging team compositions just enough to look reasonable. His calm, structured reasoning and willingness to include suspected players made him feel like a cautious good leader rather than an obvious Merlin.",
        "Charlie": "Played like a classic cautious good role, asking questions and trying to rationalize team selections, which fit nicely with Percival\u2019s info without outing it. Their balance of doubt and acceptance made them look like a thoughtful villager rather than a power role.",
        "Diana": "Projected strong early-game trustworthiness by being on multiple successful teams and keeping her table talk simple and direct. She didn\u2019t over-argue her reads, which made her look like a stable core good and a safe inclusion for most missions.",
        "Eve": "Morgana was understated; she didn\u2019t push hard, flashy reads that would scream fake Merlin, instead blending into the general good chorus. That subtlety made it harder for me to leverage her as a clear Merlin decoy in the assassination phase.",
        "Grace": "Oberon\u2019s presence felt more like a chaotic or disconnected read source than a coordinated evil partner, which is appropriate but made evil\u2019s overall narrative less cohesive. Her contributions sometimes introduced noise that good could safely ignore rather than productive misdirection we could build on."

However, I didn\u2019t do enough to subtly support the assassin\u2019s information or create extra doubt around Merlin, and I should have paid more attention to mission team patterns to anticipate how good was reading the game.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Consistently ended up on successful teams and projected a straightforward, trustworthy vibe, which made her a natural lightning rod for the assassin\u2019s guess. She seemed comfortable being repeatedly picked, which reinforced the impression that she was central good rather than cautious or evasive.",
        "Bob": "Played an extremely low-key Merlin game, avoiding the failed Mission 3 while getting onto the key successful missions, especially the final one. His lack of overt steering made him blend in as a regular good player and successfully divert the kill away from himself.",
        "Charlie": "As Percival, he appeared willing to trust and go along with teams rather than loudly directing, which helped keep Merlin\u2019s identity obscured. His participation on both an early safe team and the final mission suggested he had a quiet but correct read on where the safety was.",
        "Diana": "Frequently included on successful missions, she projected a consistently reliable good-player image. Her presence on the one failed mission alongside Frank didn\u2019t seem to draw much suspicion, indicating she maintained a solid table image throughout.",
        "Eve": "As Morgana, she drew the assassin kill toward Alice instead of Bob, which shows she sold herself well as a Merlin candidate to Percival. However, the final guess on Alice suggests that while she created some confusion, she and the team didn\u2019t fully lock onto Bob\u2019s subtle Merlin play.",
        "Frank": "As Mordred, he likely coordinated the single fail on Mission 3 while avoiding being broadly suspected afterward. Being on the only failed team but not becoming the obvious scapegoat suggests he managed his table talk and tone well enough to keep heavy heat off himself."
