I could improve by creating slightly clearer but still ambiguous voting patterns that subtly mislead good without making me stand out, especially around Missions 4 and 5 where good consolidated too much trust.",

        "Alice": "Played as a generally trusted anchor, especially after being on a clean Mission 1 and later clean missions, which made others comfortable reusing her on teams. She seemed to lean on mission results more than social reads, which made her slow to revise trust once she\u2019d mentally cleared someone.",
        "Charlie": "As Mordred, Charlie applied pressure effectively on Mission 2 by helping generate a strong fail while not becoming the obvious culprit afterward. His presence on that early failed team created a lot of noisy WIFOM that never fully got resolved against him.",
        "Diana": "Diana played a cautious, logic-oriented good, trying to reconcile mission histories systematically, especially later in the game. That methodical style made her teams look reasoned and safe, which ironically helped solidify the final, wrong trust configuration.",
        "Eve": "As Morgana, Eve embraced the high-impact evil role well by contributing to the double-fail on Mission 2 and adding confusion around who the power roles might be. Her willingness to be on a suspicious early fail helped take heat off later evil decision points.",
        "Frank": "As Merlin, Frank hid well enough during the missions to avoid obvious outing, maintaining a believable good perspective that didn\u2019t scream \u2018information advantage\u2019. However, his visible centrality and influence on the final successful teams ultimately gave the assassin enough of a signal to pick him correctly.",
        "Grace": "Grace played an engaged Percival, trying to parse between Merlin and Morgana signals, which contributed to trusting the wrong structure by the end. Her early inclusion on a clean Mission 1 and later successes made her reads feel very credible to the table, amplifying any misreads she had about the power roles."

      "player_observations": {

        "Eve": "As Morgana, did strong early disruptive work (notably on Mission 2 with the double fail) and leaned into a more visible, active role that helped draw Merlin\u2019s attention and suspicion toward herself.",

        "Grace": "As Percival, appeared to trust Frank and Alice quite a bit, and her choices on early and mid-game teams contributed to Frank surviving while still looking sufficiently central to the good strategy."

I could improve by pushing harder, earlier, on the logical implications of Mission 2\u2019s double fail and Mission 3\u2019s single fail, and by being more vocal in thread so that Merlin (Frank) had more cover and the assassin had a harder time locking onto him.",

        "Alice": "You played a very calm, trustworthy good game, and your inclusion on both a failed (Mission 2) and then later successful teams made you look ambiguously but ultimately reasonably good.

You didn\u2019t overtalk or oversteer, which made it harder for good to confidently pin you down as the source of the fail.",
        "Charlie": "You leaned into the chaos as Mordred on the early critical Mission 2, where the double fail really muddied the waters and made that whole trio look suspect. Your positioning afterward stayed just reasonable enough that you weren\u2019t forced into the spotlight, which was effective evil play.",
        "Eve": "As Morgana, you contributed to the high confusion from Mission 2 and then managed to stay relatively unexposed afterward, which helped keep suspicion distributed. Your alignment with evil narratives without being loud or flashy helped protect the actual failers on that mission.",
        "Frank": "Your Merlin game was strong on reading the table and steering us toward the correct good block by Missions 4 and 5, but your accuracy and confidence made you look like a standout good player and thus an attractive assassination target. A touch more hesitation or occasional misdirection might have given you better cover without sacrificing too much team quality.",
        "Grace": "You played a very logical and persuasive Percival, and your leadership on Mission 1 plus later team choices helped set a trustworthy tone around you. Your reads and interactions around Frank likely contributed to the assassin narrowing in on him, which is a compliment to how convincingly you treated him as cleared but also a small vulnerability in Merlin protection."
