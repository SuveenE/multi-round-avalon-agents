Your team selections and acceptance pattern looked logical from a good player perspective, which made it difficult to build suspicion on you.",
        "Eve": "You played a very controlled Merlin game\u2014careful enough not to be obvious, but subtly influential in getting strong teams through. The fact that we killed Grace instead of you shows you balanced giving good info with hiding just well enough.",
        "Grace": "As Percival, you sold the idea that you could plausibly be Merlin, which successfully drew the assassination away from Eve. Your voting and table talk had a confident, informed tone that made you look like a strong info role rather than just a generic good player."

        "Alice": "Played very quietly and blended into the background, which fit Oberon\u2019s hidden-evil role but also made it hard to read or use her behavior strategically.",
        "Bob": "Showed a very straightforward, cooperative good playstyle, trusting successful teams quickly and not overcomplicating decisions once patterns looked safe.",
        "Charlie": "As Morgana, projected confidence and early trustworthiness, especially on Mission 1, but didn\u2019t generate enough late-game suspicion to redirect the assassin cleanly.",
        "Diana": "Came across as solid and trustworthy, with calm, consistent decisions on missions that reinforced the narrative of a stable good core.",
        "Eve": "Signaled information subtly and very efficiently as Merlin, guiding team choices without drawing too much attention and successfully avoiding the assassin.",
        "Frank": "Stayed relatively controlled and low-key as Mordred, avoiding obvious sabotage patterns but also not creating enough credible alternative Merlin candidates in the endgame."
