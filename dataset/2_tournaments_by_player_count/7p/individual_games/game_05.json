        "Alice": "You played Mordred very cleanly, blending into discussions and getting onto key teams without drawing much heat, especially on Missions 2 and 4. Your double-fail mission with Charlie was bold yet believable, which created a lot of confusion around which of you (if not both) was evil.",
        "Charlie": "You leaned into the Morgana ambiguity well, projecting confident reads that made it harder for Percival and others to separate you from me. Your willingness to put multiple evils on Mission 2 and still manage the fallout showed a strong sense of how to shape the narrative afterward.",
        "Diana": "You played a very straightforward good game, generally trusting early success signals and being cautious but not paralyzed after Mission 2\u2019s fail. Your willingness to go on critical missions, even under some suspicion, kept options open for good but also made it easier for evil to muddy the waters around you.",
        "Eve": "As Oberon, you managed to stay under the radar enough to get onto two failing missions, which is impressive given your lack of coordination with other evil roles. Your table presence was low-key, which helped you avoid strong suspicion even as you ended up on multiple bad teams.",
        "Frank": "You played cautiously and felt fairly transparent as good, which is helpful for Merlin but unfortunately didn\u2019t convert into you driving strong alternative team proposals late. When under pressure, you seemed more reactive than agenda-setting, which made it easier for evil voices to dominate mission selection.",
        "Grace": "You leaned into the Percival role actively, but the Morgana/Merlin ambiguity clearly pulled you off the correct alignment reads at key moments. Your strong, confident pushes were impactful, which is great when you\u2019re right, but in this game they unintentionally amplified evil narratives around the failing missions."

        "Eve": "As Oberon, their signals were noisy and somewhat disconnected from the main evil strategy, but the general confusion this created indirectly helped keep good from cleanly coordinating.",
        "Frank": "Showed a preference for clear, reasoned arguments and appeared reluctant to commit hard to accusations without strong mission evidence, which made him look reliably good but not especially disruptive to evil.",
        "Grace": "As Percival, she was very focused on identifying Merlin through subtle behavior, but her caution made her slow to act decisively on those reads, giving evil more room to maneuver around her suspicions."

        "Grace": "As Percival, Grace\u2019s early involvement on the Mission 2 fail team put her in a tricky trust position, yet she still managed to maintain enough credibility that people didn\u2019t hard-clear her as evil, suggesting her Merlin-reading and table talk were somewhat conflicted but not blatantly off."

        "Alice": "Played aggressively but in a way that blended well with general table chaos; as Mordred, she managed to avoid being firmly pinned as evil even after the double-fail mission. She seemed comfortable taking calculated risks on team compositions that advanced evil\u2019s win condition.",
        "Bob": "His playstyle was measured and logic-driven, often grounding discussions with structured reasoning, which fits how Merlin can quietly steer outcomes without overreaching. He managed to guide teams toward some good outcomes early on while avoiding making himself an obvious night-knowledge role.",

She didn\u2019t over-assert herself, which made her look more trustworthy but also less influential.",
        "Frank": "Played cautiously and somewhat reactively, often following the louder voices rather than driving the table direction. This made him appear fairly neutral and non-threatening, which is typical of newer or more conservative good players.",
        "Grace": "Her play was assertive and protective toward players she suspected might be Merlin, which fits Percival\u2019s perspective. She seemed to rely heavily on reading tone and conviction, which made her vulnerable to Morgana\u2019s misdirection."

I need to be more assertive about calling out suspicious patterns (especially the double-fail on Mission 2 and the single-fail on Mission 3) and coordinating with likely trusted players instead of mostly following others\u2019 logic.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "She played very subtly evil, blending into reasonable team suggestions while managing to get onto a critical failing mission without drawing too much suspicion. Her ability to look like a reasonable pick for Mission 2 and Mission 4 shows she\u2019s good at hiding in the middle of the pack rather than at the extremes.",
        "Bob": "As Merlin, he balanced sharing information with staying alive, but his team preferences weren\u2019t forceful or clear enough for the table to reliably follow them. His relatively frequent inclusion on teams and lack of strong resistance to certain lineups made it harder for good to read who he actually distrusted.",
        "Charlie": "He leaned into a confident, slightly commanding style that fit Morgana well, creating plausible arguments that made him seem informed rather than suspicious. The double-fail on his Mission 2 team suggests he was comfortable taking high-risk, high-reward plays to quickly tilt the game in evil\u2019s favor.",
        "Diana": "She played like a cautious good player, willing to go on a risky team (Mission 3) but not loudly directing others, which made her seem more neutral than actively cleared. Her inclusion on multiple failing teams made her look ambiguous, and she didn\u2019t push hard to reframe suspicion away from herself with strong counter-arguments.",
        "Eve": "As Oberon, she came across as somewhat chaotic or hard to read, which unintentionally fit the role and made it difficult for good to confidently classify her. Getting onto the failing Mission 3 and then leading the failing Mission 4 showed she was comfortable making sharp, pivotal moves once she had the opportunity.",
        "Grace": "As Percival, she appeared to trust the wrong signals, likely reading Charlie\u2019s confidence as Merlin-like, which steered good away from the right deductions. Her votes and team preferences had influence, and when she leaned the wrong way, it gave evil cover to operate under her apparent endorsement."

        "Alice": "Comfortably took high-risk spots, joining Mission 2 and 4 and still avoiding hard, early suspicion despite being tied to multiple fails, which suggests a calm, low-reactive evil style that relies on others to over-explain for her.",
        "Bob": "Played a relatively subtle Merlin, feeding just enough soft resistance to suspicious teams without sounding like he had perfect info, but perhaps so understated that it was easy for evil (and me as Percival) to discount his perspective compared to louder voices.",
        "Charlie": "Sold the Morgana bluff very convincingly by confidently stepping into the \u2018trusted core\u2019 early and accepting heat from the double-fail Mission 2 in a way that felt almost too risky for evil, which made the deception more believable.",
        "Diana": "Played like a straightforward, mission-focused good player\u2014her inclusion on the failed Mission 3 and 4 teams didn\u2019t come with strong self-defense theatrics, which made her look oddly neutral and therefore easier for evil to keep in mixed teams.",

        "Frank": "Came across as solidly good and low-drama, with a style that doesn\u2019t over-argue reads; that quiet reliability made it harder to distinguish his true alignment but also meant he didn\u2019t strongly shift team-building away from suspicious configurations."
