I also trusted Frank a bit too much after Mission 2\u2019s success and didn\u2019t adequately re-evaluate when Mission 3 and 4 failed, so I should have been more aggressive in questioning my priors and pushing alternative team comps.",

        "Alice": "You leaned into the Merlin/Morgana ambiguity well, especially by taking Mission 1 and then later leading a failing mission in a way that still left you plausibly good. Your table talk seemed confidently informative without overclaiming, which made you a very convincing Merlin candidate.",
        "Bob": "You flew under the radar for a long time, especially by participating in a failing Mission 3 without drawing huge heat afterward. Your Mission 4 leadership felt calculated to anchor an evil-heavy team while still looking like you were following established trust patterns.",
        "Charlie": "You played a fairly low-profile good game, which made it harder to build or break strong reads around you. Your votes and comments felt generally honest but not forceful enough to shift the table when it mattered.",
        "Eve": "You were quite subtle as Merlin, not over-directing the table and often letting others take the spotlight, which unfortunately made it easier for Morgana to outshine you as the obvious information role. Your nudges were usually in the right direction but sometimes too soft to overturn the emerging consensus.",
        "Frank": "You came across as very genuinely good, especially after the clean second mission, which made you a central anchor in many team builds. That real trust, however, also let evil hide behind you on later missions without facing enough resistance.",
        "Grace": "You created a lot of ambiguity with your voting and team preferences, which fit Oberon well by making it hard to place you in a coherent good or evil block. Your late-game positioning contributed to confusion around which mix of players could reasonably be evil."
