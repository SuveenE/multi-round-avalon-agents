        "Charlie": "Blended in very well as Morgana, staying active in discussion without pushing too hard, which made his accusations seem reasonable rather than agenda-driven. His presence on Mission 3 and 4 teams while still feeling \u2018plausibly good\u2019 was a key factor in evil\u2019s success.",
        "Diana": "As Merlin, she was subtle to the point of sometimes being hard to distinguish from a cautious generic good player, which protected her but didn\u2019t clearly steer the table away from bad teams. Her soft pushes were accurate in hindsight, but they weren\u2019t forceful enough to flip consensus at crucial votes.",
        "Eve": "As Percival, she appeared genuinely conflicted between possible Merlin candidates, which made her reads feel honest but also somewhat scattered. Her uncertainty reduced the protective pressure on the real Merlin and gave evil more room to shape the narrative.",
        "Frank": "Played a very quiet, somewhat chaotic Oberon game, creating just enough confusion that his alignment was hard to lock in either way. His early Mission 1 success with me built a misleading sense of trust that carried later into Mission 4.",
        "Grace": "As Mordred, she did an excellent job anchoring suspicion elsewhere after the failed Mission 2, deflecting blame onto her teammates and the mission composition instead of herself. Her calm, analytical tone made her seem like a \u2018voice of reason,\u2019 which helped evil control the mid-game team selections."

        "Bob": "Came across as earnest and proactive, often taking initiative on team discussions. However, he seemed quite trusting of early narratives and was slow to pivot after the Mission 3 and 4 fails, which evil used to keep suspicion away from the real threats.",
        "Charlie": "Blended in well as evil by not being too loud or too quiet, maintaining a believable mid-activity profile. Managed to stay off the most obvious suspicion lists despite being on the failing Mission 3 team, which shows good timing in when to push and when to sit back.",
        "Eve": "Seemed to be actively hunting for Merlin and over-focusing on subtle tone/read differences, which sometimes pulled attention away from solving team compositions. As Percival, their uncertainty about which of Charlie/Grace/Alice might be Merlin-like let evil get more space than ideal.",
        "Frank": "Played somewhat erratically, which made him hard to read and unintentionally gave cover to evil decisions. His presence on the double-fail Mission 4 team added confusion rather than clarity, as his chaotic style made it tricky to separate genuine town noise from potential evil intent.",
        "Grace": "Very effective as evil at looking reasonable and measured, especially when leading Mission 2 and navigating its single fail. She positioned herself as a logical voice in discussions and avoided being overly forceful, which let her guide outcomes without attracting the level of suspicion her role warranted."

        "Grace": "Took advantage of Mission 2 to quietly create confusion without overexplaining, and maintained a measured, somewhat neutral table presence that made it hard to pin her as a strong evil candidate."
