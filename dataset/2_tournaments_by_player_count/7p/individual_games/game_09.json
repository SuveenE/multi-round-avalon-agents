        "Diana": "Played actively and looked genuinely engaged in solving the puzzle, which fit Percival well; her apparent trust in certain players influenced the table, even if it didn\u2019t ultimately land on the right evil combo.",
        "Eve": "Her play read as genuinely good and transparent, and the mission 2 setup with her on it felt more unfortunate than suspicious; she seemed to make logical arguments but maybe didn\u2019t push hard enough against recurring evil picks.",
        "Frank": "Came across as thoughtful and information-driven, consistent with Merlin trying to steer outcomes subtly; he tried to avoid being too obvious, but in hindsight his team preferences were often closer to correct than the table gave him credit for.",
        "Grace": "Assertive and confident in team building, which worked well to guide outcomes toward evil; as Morgana she leaned into a persuasive, central role that made her look more like a power good role than a potential source of fails."

      "self_assessment": "I stayed reasonably quiet and let suspicion swirl around others, which helped evil win without drawing too much attention to myself, especially on Mission 4 when I could safely play fail with cover from other evils. I could improve by more actively shaping the table talk and reads earlier in the game, so that by the time the later missions came around I had more influence over who was trusted or doubted.",

        "Alice": "Alice played Mordred very smoothly, getting onto multiple teams and blending in as a consistent, low-drama pick while still participating in key fails. Her positioning made her look like a safe default choice for leaders who didn\u2019t have strong alternative reads.",
        "Bob": "Bob\u2019s play was straightforwardly good-aligned and fairly trusting, which made him read as genuine but also a bit easy to steer. He didn\u2019t push hard meta-narratives, which reduced his impact but also kept him from becoming a major target of suspicion.",
        "Diana": "As Percival, Diana tried to read Merlin from mission outcomes but didn\u2019t aggressively hard-clear or hard-push anyone, which limited Percival\u2019s protective impact. Her early willingness to put Frank on Mission 1 helped establish him as a trusted figure later.",
        "Eve": "Eve\u2019s leadership on Mission 2 showed some willingness to experiment with team comps but ultimately included the wrong mix, which hurt good\u2019s info and trust network. She seemed to balance caution with a bit of risk, but not in a way that strongly anchored the good team\u2019s reads.",
        "Frank": "Frank, as Merlin, was cautious and didn\u2019t overly reveal his knowledge, which helped him survive but left good without a strong, assertive guiding voice. His inclusion patterns did suggest some hidden info, but not clearly enough to pull the table firmly toward a mostly-good team.",
        "Grace": "Grace as Morgana projected a convincingly Merlin-adjacent aura, inserting herself into mission discussions and getting onto the critical Mission 4 team. Her willingness to take the spotlight and coordinate a heavy fail there was decisive for the evil win."

I also failed to clearly communicate a consistent good-team narrative, which let evil coordinate quietly while good stayed fragmented.",

        "Charlie": "Stayed relatively under the radar and let others drive the discussion, which worked well for Oberon in this game because no one had strong, concrete reasons to push against him.",
        "Eve": "Took a proactive role in team discussions but got dragged into a bad mission as a good player; once that happened, she struggled to reset the table\u2019s read on her alignment.",
        "Frank": "Subtly guided team choices without over-asserting, which is strong Merlin play, but his caution also allowed Grace and Alice to maintain credibility longer than ideal.",
        "Grace": "Very assertive and persuasive in mission discussions, effectively using the Morgana/Frank ambiguity to appear like a confident, informed good player and steer key teams into fails."

I need to be more vocal in challenging successful-looking but suspicious lineups and in re-evaluating my reads after every mission result, especially after Mission 2 and 3 pointed strongly to a concentrated evil cluster around Frank\u2019s and Grace\u2019s teams.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Played a very controlled, low-key evil game: going on two missions (1 and 3) and only failing 3, which made her look safer because of the clean first mission. She leaned into the early trust from Diana and Frank and didn\u2019t overtalk, which let her slide as a \u2018reliable\u2019 pick until the disastrous Mission 4 exposed how much evil was concentrated around her.",
        "Bob": "As a good player who only went on the failed Mission 2, he ended up looking suspicious by association but actually played a relatively quiet, reactive game. Because he didn\u2019t push strong alternative theories, it was easy for evil to keep him in a gray area instead of being cleared as solidly good.",
        "Charlie": "As Oberon, he stayed quite under the radar and didn\u2019t strongly coordinate or push agendas, which fit both a cautious good and an isolated evil profile. Joining the triple-fail Mission 4 without much resistance helped close the game for evil while keeping his earlier game low-impact and hard to read.",
        "Diana": "Her Mission 1 team choice (Frank + Alice) inadvertently gave evil a clean success and built a lot of trust around that combination. As Percival, she was clearly trying to protect/perceive Merlin, but the early success with both Frank and Alice on it made it easier for Morgana to hide and for that trust structure to persist longer than it should have.",
        "Frank": "As Merlin, he walked a very fine line: his team choices and mission involvement (especially Mission 3) were subtly steered but not blatantly so, which unfortunately didn\u2019t prevent that mission from failing. His signaling was cautious enough that good didn\u2019t fully lock onto the right evil team, and some of his apparent trust in Alice and Grace made it harder for the rest of us to break from those assumptions.",
        "Grace": "As Morgana, she did an excellent job blending in and leveraging the Merlin/Morgana ambiguity, especially around Missions 2 and 4. Leading the final mission and including three evils while still making it feel somewhat plausible showed strong social positioning\u2014she benefited a lot from the credibility created by earlier missions and didn\u2019t appear overly pushy or desperate."

        "Diana": "As Percival, she did a solid job of looking generally trustworthy and was quickly accepted as a safe pick, but our Merlin/Morgana signals clearly weren\u2019t resolved strongly enough in town\u2019s favor.",
        "Eve": "Played like a very reasonable, logic-driven good player, but her leadership on Mission 2 and inclusion of me and Grace gave evil an early inroad and some credibility to Grace.",
