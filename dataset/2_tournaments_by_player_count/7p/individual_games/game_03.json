Your decisions tended to track with revealed information rather than big gambles, which made you look consistently, quietly good and helped stabilize trust around you by the end.",
        "Diana": "You were a very convincing early-game good voice, especially with how comfortable you looked after the success on Mission 1. The sharp contrast between that and the catastrophic triple-fail Mission 2 made your position tricky, but you still tried to maintain a narrative of shared blame rather than personal guilt, which is a very classic, social-heavy evil approach.",
        "Eve": "You came across as sincerely analytical and open, and your willingness to go on multiple successful missions built you a strong good aura. The fact that you drew the Assassin\u2019s shot as Merlin shows how naturally you occupied the \u2018informed, slightly central\u2019 table role without appearing too certain or omniscient.",
        "Frank": "Your play as Oberon felt subtly detached from coordinated evil signaling, which actually made table reads on you harder because your mistakes didn\u2019t line up cleanly with other evils\u2019 incentives. You had moments of awkward positioning\u2014especially around the fallout of Mission 2\u2014that looked more like confused good than calculated evil, which is a powerful asset for Oberon when it doesn\u2019t accidentally burn your team\u2019s cover."
