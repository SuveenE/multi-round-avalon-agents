          "game_result": "lost",
          "self_assessment": "I created early cover for evil by failing Mission 1 in a way that cast doubt on both myself and Eve, but I didn\u2019t manage to leverage that suspicion later to protect Merlin\u2019s identity or guide the assassin effectively. As Oberon, I should have focused more on reading voting patterns and mission team compositions to infer who my fellow evils and Merlin were, instead of just relying on the mission results themselves. Next time I need to use my own suspicious image more proactively to misdirect good and subtly shield the real Merlin suspect.",
          "player_observations": {
            "Bob": "Bob played like a classic soft power role\u2014he avoided being on the failed missions while consistently ending up on critical successful ones, especially the last mission. His calm, consistent inclusion in successful teams fit Percival well: he projected trust without over-claiming insight, which helped him stay alive and look like a strong candidate for Merlin.",
            "Charlie": "Charlie navigated the missions with surgical precision: always on the key successful teams but never appearing too forceful in accusations, which let him guide team choices without drawing a loud Merlin target on himself. His willingness to repeat the same trio (Bob, Charlie, Diana) and argue for their reliability was a very quiet but effective way to steer the game.",
            "Diana": "Diana\u2019s steady presence on Missions 2, 3, and 4 made her look like a reliable, middle-of-the-pack good player, especially with two clean successes early. Even after being on the failed Mission 4, she didn\u2019t attract lasting suspicion, suggesting her table talk and voting patterns felt consistent and trustworthy to most players.",
            "Eve": "Eve\u2019s early pairing with me on the failed Mission 1 gave her plausible deniability\u2014she could pivot to blaming me while gradually realigning with whatever the emerging consensus was. As Morgana, she didn\u2019t overplay being insightful; instead she blended in, which helped maintain ambiguity between her and Bob for who might be Merlin/percival.",
            "Frank": "Frank\u2019s single appearance on the failed Mission 4 was high impact but also high risk, and the fact that the final mission excluded him suggests that failure heavily damaged his perceived reliability. As Mordred, his low table presence (in terms of mission involvement) made it hard for him to shape the narrative later in the game.",
            "Grace": "Grace only appeared on the final mission but did so in a way that fit a \u2018safe late-game inclusion\u2019 profile\u2014someone not heavily implicated in earlier controversies, which made it easier for good to trust her. Her relatively clean record and lack of association with earlier fails helped solidify the final successful team composition."

          "self_assessment": "I stayed consistently on successful teams and maintained a trustworthy table image, which helped Good secure a strong mission record and likely contributed to the Assassin guessing me as Merlin. I could improve by being a bit more vocal about my suspicions and reasoning, especially after the failed Mission 3, to better guide discussion without looking too obvious.",
          "player_observations": {
            "Bob": "Played a very controlled and subtle Merlin game, consistently landing on correct teams while not drawing too much heat until the end. His leadership on Mission 4, with a fully clean team, showed strong information use and timing.",
            "Charlie": "As early leader, he started the game on a clean team and projected a generally trustworthy presence. His later inclusion on the successful Mission 4 suggests he adapted well to emerging information and looked genuinely towny.",
            "Diana": "Was repeatedly on successful teams and helped establish a solid early track record for Good. Her presence on the one failed mission made her a plausible suspect, but overall she maintained a calm, cooperative style that kept her in consideration for good teams.",
            "Eve": "As Morgana, she seemed to play a more subtle evil game, letting others take center stage in leadership and suspicion. Her deception was good enough that Merlin survived, suggesting she didn\u2019t overforce herself as a target of Percival.",
            "Frank": "As Mordred, he timed his sabotage on Mission 3 effectively to disrupt the strong early run of Good missions. However, that fail didn\u2019t translate into sustained misdirection, as Good still rebuilt confidence and formed a clean Mission 4 team.",
            "Grace": "As Oberon, her hidden-evil status likely made her coordination with the other evil players weaker, which showed in the overall mission outcomes. Her impact seemed more muted and less influential on team selections and table direction."

          "self_assessment": "I coordinated well with Diana on Mission 2 to create a strong early fail and later took a risky but plausible single-fail on Mission 4 to stay in the mix. I need to improve at Merlin-hunting\u2014underestimating Grace\u2019s quiet influence and over-focusing on Eve cost us the game, and I could have done more to frame Grace earlier while keeping my own image cleaner.",
          "player_observations": {
            "Bob": "Very steady and trust-focused, leaned heavily on the clean track record of the teams he was on and used that to justify the final Mission 5 pick; feels like a player who prefers safe, consensus-driven choices.",
            "Charlie": "Played an extremely clean, low-drama good role, rarely attracting suspicion and consistently ending up on successful teams, which made them a natural anchor for trust.",
            "Diana": "Aggressive as evil in Mission 2 with a full triple-fail, showing a willingness to take big swings early; generally projected confidence, which helped keep heat off her later.",
            "Eve": "Appeared very straightforward and transparent, which made her look like a solid, reliable good player and drew assassin attention; her presence on multiple clean missions reinforced that image.",
            "Frank": "As Oberon, came across somewhat disconnected from table narrative and reads, which made them hard to coordinate with but also not a central focus of suspicion or trust.",
            "Grace": "Played an excellent subtle Merlin\u2014avoided being a loud table captain while still nudging teams toward strong good-heavy lineups, especially Mission 3 and the final mission; her influence was felt in outcomes more than in overt table talk, which kept her under the assassin radar."

          "self_assessment": "As Oberon, I stayed quiet enough that I didn\u2019t draw attention, but I also failed to generate any meaningful confusion or suspicion around the real Merlin, which let good win fairly cleanly. I should have been more proactive in subtly undermining trust in Eve and Grace, even without coordination, and tried to create at least one messy mission to give the assassin a better information landscape.",
          "player_observations": {
            "Bob": "Played very straightforward and low-drama; his acceptance on the successful missions made him look steadily more trustworthy without needing bold moves.",

            "Diana": "Came across as calm and reliably good, and her leadership on Mission 2 reinforced that image by proposing a safe team that passed cleanly.",
            "Eve": "Disguised Merlin very effectively by not coming off as overly controlling, subtly shepherding good teams without making herself an obvious high-value target.",
            "Frank": "Stayed under the radar as Mordred and didn\u2019t create much noise, but that also meant he didn\u2019t generate the chaos needed to open up multiple plausible Merlin candidates.",
            "Grace": "Gave off strong \u2018likely power role\u2019 vibes at times with confident trust patterns, which made her a tempting but ultimately wrong assassination target."

          "self_assessment": "I coordinated well with Charlie by doubling up fails on Mission 2, which created strong suspicion on Grace and muddied Merlin\u2019s reads, and I timed my later fail on Mission 4 to close the game without overexposing myself earlier. I could improve by being a bit more visibly torn or hesitant on the critical mission votes to look more genuinely good-aligned, and by more actively steering table talk to frame Diana and Frank rather than mostly letting suspicion develop organically.",
          "player_observations": {
            "Bob": "You played a very controlled Merlin, often avoiding hard accusations and instead nudging team comps subtly, which helped you stay alive but sometimes left good with less clarity than they needed.",
            "Charlie": "You leaned into an aggressive evil style, especially by contributing to the double-fail on Mission 2, creating maximum chaos and giving us a lot of cover early.",
            "Diana": "You tended to trust early successes too much and were slow to fully pivot after Mission 3 failed, which made you look consistently good but also made it easier for evil to sneak onto later teams.",
            "Eve": "As Oberon, your actions and voting patterns were somewhat off-beat and hard to read, which accidentally helped us by adding noise and making it harder for good to form a clean consensus.",
            "Frank": "You played very cautiously, often following the emerging table consensus rather than driving it, which made you appear reliably good but also meant your influence on final team selections was limited.",
            "Grace": "You played an assertive Percival, strongly defending your Merlin reads, but the double-fail on Mission 2 put you under heavy suspicion and you struggled to fully recover your credibility afterward."

          "self_assessment": "I picked a risky team on Mission 3 that gave evil a clean, low-information fail and I didn\u2019t push hard enough to publicly pressure-test suspects afterward. I did reasonably well staying flexible with my reads and not tunneling too early, but I should have cross-checked team patterns more aggressively with how Diana and Eve were behaving around approvals.",
          "player_observations": {
            "Bob": "Tended to build fairly safe, consensus-friendly teams, which made him look reliably good, but also let evil hide within his choices. His Mission 4 team showed he was willing to trust too broadly under pressure.",
            "Charlie": "Played a very smooth, low-conflict game and avoided drawing heat, which is classic Morgana behavior\u2014helpful, agreeable, and just active enough to seem engaged but not suspicious. He blended into good\u2019s general narrative rather than driving his own.",
            "Diana": "Came across as quietly confident and subtly steered voting without over-explaining, which fit Merlin: she nudged away from danger more than she hard-accused anyone. Her restraint in table talk kept her from being obviously night-killed but may also have limited how much good could coordinate around her signals.",
            "Eve": "Played actively and seemed to be searching for alignment signals, and her behavior generally tracked with someone trying to protect a hidden information role. At times she appeared torn between following Diana\u2019s soft pushes and her own reads, which created some mixed signals for the table.",
            "Frank": "Stayed relatively detached and a bit off-beat in his voting and comments, which made him hard to read and fit Oberon\u2019s isolated role. His low-visibility style made it difficult for good to get reliable alignment info from his decisions.",
            "Grace": "Did a strong job as Mordred of blending in as a reasonable voice and using the Mission 2 fail to sow confusion without over-committing to a narrative. She took advantage of trust given to her early to influence team compositions in subtle but impactful ways."

I could have contributed more by subtly influencing discussion dynamics and sowing targeted doubt around mission 2 and 3 without drawing attention to myself.",
          "player_observations": {
            "Bob": "Played a cautious Merlin, often positioning himself on early teams and pushing subtly rather than hard-accusing, which helped him avoid looking too obviously informed. However, his consistent inclusion on successful/\u2018safe\u2019-seeming teams eventually made him look central to good coordination.",
            "Charlie": "Acted like a protective Percival, frequently aligning with Bob and soft-defending him, which signaled that he likely saw Bob as a power role. His attempts to steer suspicion toward others were measured but a bit transparent once fails started clustering away from Bob.",
            "Diana": "As Morgana, she leaned into being an assertive voice, offering confident reads that made her look like a strong good player. Her presence on the double-fail mission was risky but her prior social capital helped blunt the suspicion that should have landed on her more heavily.",
            "Eve": "Played Mordred as a flexible saboteur, willing to be on both risky and safe-looking teams and timing her visible opposition carefully. She contributed to mission fails without becoming the primary scapegoat, which helped maintain uncertainty about where evil was centered.",
            "Frank": "As good, he seemed genuinely uncertain and followed table consensus more than driving it, which made him look honest but also somewhat manipulable. His early inclusion on teams and lack of strong resistance to evil narratives helped those missions go the way evil wanted.",
            "Grace": "Adopted a more analytical but slightly reactive good playstyle, often voicing concerns after key mission outcomes rather than pre-emptively. Her suspicion tended to scatter, which relieved pressure on the actual evil players and limited good\u2019s ability to consolidate a clear narrative."

            "Eve": "Came across as genuinely good-leaning, especially by being on all three successful missions and not over-claiming insight. Her natural-seeming trust patterns made her a believable information role candidate, which likely contributed to the Assassin mistaking her for Merlin.",
            "Frank": "As Oberon, his play felt a bit disconnected from the broader evil coordination, which showed in how his suspicion distribution didn\u2019t cleanly protect his teammates. His leadership on the disastrous Mission 2 looked more chaotic than calculated, adding noise rather than a clearly crafted evil narrative.",
            "Grace": "Played a very measured Merlin, giving just enough guidance to steer good toward strong teams (especially Missions 3 and 5) without looking omniscient. Her balance of soft pushes and willingness to sit back at key moments made it hard for evil to lock onto her, which paid off in the failed assassination."

            "Charlie": "You leaned into the chaos as Mordred on the early critical Mission 2, where the double fail really muddied the waters and made that whole trio look suspect. Your positioning afterward stayed just reasonable enough that you weren\u2019t forced into the spotlight, which was effective evil play.",
            "Eve": "As Morgana, you contributed to the high confusion from Mission 2 and then managed to stay relatively unexposed afterward, which helped keep suspicion distributed. Your alignment with evil narratives without being loud or flashy helped protect the actual failers on that mission.",
            "Frank": "Your Merlin game was strong on reading the table and steering us toward the correct good block by Missions 4 and 5, but your accuracy and confidence made you look like a standout good player and thus an attractive assassination target. A touch more hesitation or occasional misdirection might have given you better cover without sacrificing too much team quality.",
            "Grace": "You played a very logical and persuasive Percival, and your leadership on Mission 1 plus later team choices helped set a trustworthy tone around you. Your reads and interactions around Frank likely contributed to the assassin narrowing in on him, which is a compliment to how convincingly you treated him as cleared but also a small vulnerability in Merlin protection."

            "Frank": "As Mordred, he likely coordinated the single fail on Mission 3 while avoiding being broadly suspected afterward. Being on the only failed team but not becoming the obvious scapegoat suggests he managed his table talk and tone well enough to keep heavy heat off himself."

I could improve by seeding clearer, earlier suspicion on Alice and Diana after Mission 2\u2019s triple-fail while still making it look like deduction rather than knowledge, which might have helped good coordinate more confidently on Mission 4. Overall, my signal was just subtle enough that Bob could lean the right way without making me obvious to the Assassin.",

            "Alice": "You played aggressively and confidently, especially around Mission 2 and Mission 4, pushing yourself onto key teams in a way that looked like you were driving the game forward rather than steering it into fails. Your style leans into being a proactive leader who frames your choices as logical, which is strong as evil but also makes you a good focal point for suspicion later if missions go badly.",

As Percival, you seemed to balance attention between potential Merlin candidates without tunneling too hard, which helped you keep Eve more suspicious than me in the endgame.",

Your decisions tended to track with revealed information rather than big gambles, which made you look consistently, quietly good and helped stabilize trust around you by the end.",
            "Diana": "You were a very convincing early-game good voice, especially with how comfortable you looked after the success on Mission 1. The sharp contrast between that and the catastrophic triple-fail Mission 2 made your position tricky, but you still tried to maintain a narrative of shared blame rather than personal guilt, which is a very classic, social-heavy evil approach.",
            "Eve": "You came across as sincerely analytical and open, and your willingness to go on multiple successful missions built you a strong good aura. The fact that you drew the Assassin\u2019s shot as Merlin shows how naturally you occupied the \u2018informed, slightly central\u2019 table role without appearing too certain or omniscient.",

You had moments of awkward positioning\u2014especially around the fallout of Mission 2\u2014that looked more like confused good than calculated evil, which is a powerful asset for Oberon when it doesn\u2019t accidentally burn your team\u2019s cover."
