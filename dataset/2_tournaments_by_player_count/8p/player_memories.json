I could have pushed harder on the implications of Mission 2 and 3 fails\u2014especially pressing why Diana and Eve kept ending up on critical teams\u2014and been more vocal about protecting Frank once he started looking like a likely Merlin candidate.",

            "Grace": "Was active and engaged in deduction, but seemed heavily influenced by Eve\u2019s confident table talk; her Merlin/percival information read didn\u2019t quite land, which hurt good\u2019s late-game focus.",
            "Henry": "Played like a cautious good player, generally trusting mission data and not forcing wild theories; his conservative leadership on Mission 4 didn\u2019t manage to avoid stacking evil, but his reasoning stayed mostly consistent with a good perspective."

I also didn\u2019t push hard enough to keep Grace off the later teams, treating her mission 4 success as stronger evidence of being good than it actually was. On the positive side, I consistently kept myself on teams and helped secure the missions we did pass, but my team selection logic needed to adapt faster to the emerging fail patterns.",
          "player_observations": {
            "Bob": "Played a fairly consensus-driven, cooperative game and seemed to prioritize building broadly acceptable teams, which unfortunately led to including Grace on mission 5 and giving evil the final fail. His style felt more reactive than proactive in terms of accusing or clearing people.",
            "Charlie": "Used the successful first mission to lock in a strong appearance of innocence and leaned on that trust through the midgame. As Mordred, he timed his fails well and stayed consistent enough in his table talk that suspicion on him never fully solidified when it should have.",
            "Diana": "As Merlin, she appeared to have some good instincts but had to stay subtle, which made her nudges easy to ignore or interpret as normal table chatter. Her caution in openly pushing against specific players may have cost some influence over the final team compositions.",
            "Eve": "Played an assertive and convincingly good-leaning role, especially when joining mission 3 and contributing to the double fail that created significant confusion. She balanced being active in discussion with not drawing so much attention that she became an obvious evil candidate.",
            "Frank": "As Percival, he seemed to struggle to translate his Merlin/ Morgana information into effective steering of the group, possibly being unsure which of Diana or Eve was actually Merlin. His contributions felt earnest but not quite forceful enough to shift the table at key moments.",
            "Grace": "Maintained a relatively low-key but trustworthy image, crucially choosing success on mission 4 to appear cleared and then delivering the decisive fail on mission 5. Her willingness to blend in and avoid heavy accusation battles made her a very effective assassin here.",
            "Henry": "Was on several early teams and, because of the surrounding fails, absorbed some ambient suspicion despite being consistently good. His style was straightforward and cooperative, but he didn\u2019t push hard to reframe narratives when he was being indirectly implicated."

I also tunneled too much on team-based logic from Missions 2 and 3 without re-evaluating when new info came from Mission 4, which let evil coordinate around my uncertainty. Next time, I should be more vocal and structured about my Merlin reads so good has a clearer narrative to follow.",

I also didn\u2019t push hard enough for Henry or Frank as core picks late game, so I contributed to stacked evil presence on Missions 4 and 5.

I should have pressed harder on the pattern of Bob/Frank/Charlie/Henry being over-represented on critical missions and been more skeptical when Mission 3 failed. As leader on Mission 4, I could have tightened my team selection more aggressively around the most consistently clean players instead of spreading risk.",
          "player_observations": {
            "Bob": "Bob appeared consistently trustworthy by being on the first two successful missions, which made it easy to clear him mentally and likely made evil comfortable hiding next to him. He didn\u2019t strongly challenge later team compositions, which indirectly let evil shape Missions 3 and 5 without heavy resistance.",
            "Charlie": "Charlie slipped smoothly onto the successful Mission 2 and then onto the failing Mission 3, using that early success to mask his role as Mordred. He played a low-profile, quietly-included style that avoided drawing attention even after the first fail, which was effective at keeping suspicion spread out.",
            "Diana": "As Percival and the final mission leader, Diana tried to balance information with team selection but ended up including two evil players on Mission 5. Her team choices suggested she was partially misreading Merlin\u2019s signals or over-trusting certain players who had been on mixed-result missions. She played actively and took on responsibility, but her late-game read was just off enough to swing the result.",
            "Eve": "Eve maintained enough ambiguity to get onto the crucial Mission 4 and then the final Mission 5, contributing to both fails as the Assassin. She didn\u2019t need to be heavily vocal; her value came from blending into mid-trust territory and riding along with more central figures like Diana and Henry. Her positioning on the last mission was especially decisive.",
            "Frank": "As Merlin, Frank did an excellent job getting on early clean teams and quietly steering Missions 1 and 2 toward success. However, his later influence wasn\u2019t strong enough to keep multiple evils off Missions 3\u20135, suggesting he was being careful not to be too obvious and may have erred on the side of subtlety. His play looked consistently good-aligned from my perspective, which means he succeeded at looking trustworthy but not at fully converting that into safe endgame teams.",
            "Grace": "Grace led Mission 2 and selected a fully good team, which strongly increased her perceived reliability and mine. After that, she stayed relatively low-drama, which kept her away from heavy suspicion but also limited her late impact on steering away from bad teams. Her conservative, solid early pick helped evil later because it gave us a false sense of security in the pool of players that followed.",
            "Henry": "Henry, as Morgana, successfully embedded himself on key mid- and late-game missions (3, 4, and 5), contributing to the chain of fails while never becoming the clear consensus suspect. His willingness to sit on mixed teams and exploit the confusion around Merlin/percival reads made him look like a reasonable inclusion rather than a glaring risk. He was central to evil\u2019s success by consistently being on pivotal missions without drawing enough heat to be locked out."

After that fail, he didn\u2019t become heavily tainted, which suggests his table talk and demeanor stayed consistent enough that people viewed him as more unlucky than suspicious."

            "Frank": "As Merlin, he guided team selection subtly rather than loudly, nudging toward safer configurations without over-claiming certainty, which was good discipline. However, his slight pattern of de-prioritizing specific evil players on critical teams gave just enough of a trail for me to identify him as Merlin in the end.",

Her Mission 2 leadership was conservative and reasonable, which helped build trust in her but also reassured evil that we could pass early without much scrutiny.",
