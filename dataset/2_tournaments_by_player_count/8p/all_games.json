I know I\u2019m good, and both Charlie and Diana have argued consistently for a conservative, low-heat team without trying to force specific controversial picks (like Eve or Frank) onto Mission 1. That alignment in approach, without obvious coordination or weird agenda-pushing, makes them relatively safer picks at this stage. While a more \u2018informational\u2019 team (including Eve/Frank) could generate data, it also raises the chance of an immediate fail with no clear way to pinpoint which of them is evil. A clean pass from this trio gives us a strong baseline of likely-good players we can then mix with others in Mission 2 to generate more meaningful reads.",

That\u2019s more suspicious.\n=> I exclude Frank as the likeliest evil in {Alice, Frank, Grace, Charlie} and keep Alice, Grace, and Charlie as the core.\n\n2) Choosing from the mission 3 pool {Bob, Diana, Eve, Henry}:\nWe must add two players from this group. There are exactly two evils here, so we need to avoid them.\n- Eve and Diana both feel more suspect: they were on the double-fail mission and are each arguing themselves as preferable picks in a way that can be read as positioning.\n- Bob and Henry are more broadly treated as the \"less bad\" options: multiple players independently floated Bob as the safest from that set; Frank (despite my suspicion of him) tagged Henry as his least-bad option; Henry\u2019s own structure of wanting {Alice, Grace, Charlie} is consistent with a good read of the core, even if self-advocacy is NAI.\nGiven limited information and needing two from this pool, the best odds alignment-wise is to assume the evils here are {Diana, Eve} and therefore select Bob and Henry as the likely goods.\n\nResult: Team = {Alice, Bob, Charlie, Grace, Henry}, built on (1) excluding the most suspicious core member (Frank) and (2) taking the two least-suspected members from the mission 3 group (Bob, Henry) under the constraint that exactly two in that group are evil.",

That gives a team of three from the core (Charlie, Frank, Grace) plus the two least-bad options from the Mission 3 pool (Bob, Diana), avoiding Eve and Henry entirely and keeping us at worst to a single evil, which still can\u2019t sink this mission.",

Any size\u20115 team must therefore draw from both sets. The only team structures that even *allow* a fully good team (i.e., non-zero chance of 0 evils) are those with 3 players from the {Alice, Frank, Grace, Charlie} core and 2 players from {Bob, Diana, Eve, Henry}. Including all 4 of the core guarantees one evil, and taking 3 from the Mission 3 group guarantees at least one evil. As Diana, I know I\u2019m good, and since there are exactly two evils in {Bob, Diana, Eve, Henry}, that means the two evils are some pair in {Bob, Eve, Henry}. So to retain any chance at a clean team, I *must* include myself and exactly one of {Bob, Eve, Henry}. Based on table talk, Henry has been more widely treated as the least-bad option from the Mission 3 group by players I tentatively read as good (especially Frank), so I select Henry as the other representative from that pool. From the core, I pick Frank, Grace, and Charlie, leaving out Alice because she was on both early missions including the failed Mission 2, while Grace\u2019s combinatorial reasoning, Frank\u2019s steady guidance, and Charlie\u2019s consistent logic read slightly more town-aligned. This team (Frank, Grace, Charlie, Diana, Henry) is the only construction I can propose that both fits the structural constraints and preserves a realistic path to a fully good lineup, while weighting selections toward the players who feel most trustworthy from discussion.",

That strongly suggests at least one evil is in the A/B/C cluster plus at least one in D/E, given the double-fail on Mission 4. Instead of repeating A/B/C and pulling in both untested players F and G together as several people propose, I want to hedge against Charlie being the problem in the core and against the D/E pair that produced the double-fail. By building a team of Alice and me (Bob) from the proven early structure, then adding Frank and Grace (who have not yet appeared on any failing missions), and Henry (who was on both a success and the single-fail mission but is not entangled with the double-fail D/E pair), we exclude all of Charlie, Diana, and Eve\u2014the three most structurally implicated by the combination of the Mission 3 and Mission 4 results.

Missions 1 and 2 both succeeded with 0 fails and shared Bob and Frank; they were also both on Mission 3 (the single-fail), making it much more likely that the spy on Mission 3 was Alice or Charlie rather than both Bob and Frank suddenly choosing to fail after two clean missions. That makes Bob and Frank the best anchors. Alice is the only player on both failed missions (3 and 4), which makes her the single most suspicious player; she should be excluded. Mission 4\u2019s fail came from among {Alice, Diana, Eve, Grace, Henry}. If Alice is evil, then Diana, Eve, Grace, and Henry can all still be good; even if Alice is actually good, at most one of Diana/Eve/Grace/Henry is evil because only one fail appeared. The broad table consensus (from Charlie, Diana, Eve, Henry) converged on a core of Bob/Frank/Diana/Henry as the safest four. Between the remaining candidates for the fifth slot (Eve vs. Grace vs. Charlie vs. re-adding Alice), Eve is least tied to previous fails: Charlie is tied to the Mission 3 fail, Grace to the Mission 4 fail and to the Mission 2 spy pool, and Alice is tied to both fails. Therefore, the team Bob, Frank, Diana, Henry, and Eve uses the best-info core, removes the double-overlap Alice, avoids Charlie/Grace who are each connected to one of the fails, and aligns with the majority\u2019s preferred structure for the final mission.",
