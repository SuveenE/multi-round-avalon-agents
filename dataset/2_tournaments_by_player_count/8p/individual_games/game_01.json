I know I\u2019m good, and both Charlie and Diana have argued consistently for a conservative, low-heat team without trying to force specific controversial picks (like Eve or Frank) onto Mission 1. That alignment in approach, without obvious coordination or weird agenda-pushing, makes them relatively safer picks at this stage. While a more \u2018informational\u2019 team (including Eve/Frank) could generate data, it also raises the chance of an immediate fail with no clear way to pinpoint which of them is evil. A clean pass from this trio gives us a strong baseline of likely-good players we can then mix with others in Mission 2 to generate more meaningful reads.",
