        "Diana": "Had a relatively quiet, low-impact presence on missions, which kept her from being heavily suspected or heavily trusted. Her appearance on the failed Mission 2 didn\u2019t lead to strong follow-up defense or counter-accusation, so she kind of floated in the mid-trust zone.",
        "Eve": "Played an excellent long game as Mordred by alternating success and failure in a way that made her look cooperative early (Mission 3) and only gradually suspicious after later fails. Her ability to fail multiple critical missions from a central seat without becoming a unanimous exclusion was key for the evil win.",
        "Frank": "As Merlin, he concealed his knowledge well enough that evil never felt totally sure of his identity, especially with Grace as a strong alternative information hub. His reads influenced team choices but not in a way that screamed \u2018Merlin,\u2019 which made the endgame assassination decision non-trivial.",
        "Grace": "Very active and assertive as Percival, projecting strong confidence in her reads and anchoring a lot of table discussion.

        "Bob": "Bob (Morgana) blended in well by taking just enough risk on Mission 2 to secure a single fail while not overexposing himself later as an obvious suspect. His leadership on Mission 4 put him in a good spot to subtly push a team including an evil player (Eve) while keeping his own hands clean, which made him seem more like a thoughtful good than a coordinated evil.",
        "Charlie": "Charlie (Assassin) stayed in the background on the mission results, never being on a failing team, which preserved his endgame threat. His low direct association with failed missions likely made him a less obvious suspect and gave him more freedom to focus on reading Merlin rather than defending himself.",
        "Eve": "Eve (Mordred) played very effectively by being on two critical failing missions (4 and 5) without drawing overwhelming suspicion, which suggests she managed her table talk and reasoning well. Her inclusion on multiple late teams shows she maintained enough perceived trust that good didn\u2019t lock her out after the first fail she caused.",
        "Frank": "Frank (Merlin) did a good job of not over-signaling his information; he was on both successful and failing teams, which helped mask his role. However, from my vantage point, his pushes didn\u2019t clearly isolate the real evils in time, suggesting he had to walk a careful line between hinting and staying hidden from the assassin.",
        "Grace": "Grace (Percival) played a very central, trusted role, often ending up on key teams and helping shape the core of the supposed \u201cgood block.\u201d Her trust in the Merlin/Morgana pair seemed to land more on Frank than Bob overall, but not decisively enough to prevent evil from repeatedly infiltrating late missions.",
        "Henry": "Henry (good) looked mostly straightforward and rational, especially as leader on Mission 2 where he selected a team that unfortunately included a single evil (Bob). After that fail, he didn\u2019t become heavily tainted, which suggests his table talk and demeanor stayed consistent enough that people viewed him as more unlucky than suspicious."

In future games, I should focus on more subtle, consistent signaling and be less anchored to early reads when new mission data contradicts them.",

        "Henry": "Looked swingy after leading the failed mission 2, but then reappearing on mission 4 made him seem more like a confused good than coordinated evil, and his table talk didn\u2019t strongly crystallize any dominant read."

I let Mission 4\u2019s mixed team go through without forcefully challenging the inclusion of both Bob and Eve, and I also didn\u2019t coordinate publicly with Grace\u2019s reads as much as I should have, which made it easier for evil to slip onto the final mission.",

She was willing to go on risky mixed teams but framed them as information-gathering, which made her look reasonable even when evil was aboard.",
        "Bob": "Very sneaky and pragmatic Morgana play: he blended in by accepting some suspicion from Mission 2 but never over-defended himself, instead subtly redirecting attention to team structure and \u2018process\u2019. He was comfortable being on critical missions while staying calm under light accusations, which helped keep him viable on later teams.",
        "Charlie": "Stayed relatively low-impact most of the game, not drawing a lot of attention to himself and mainly influencing through voting and last-mission leadership. As assassin, he positioned himself as a reasonable, not-too-loud voice, which made his eventual leadership on Mission 5 feel more palatable than it should have.",
        "Diana": "Came across as earnest and straightforward good, especially after being on the failed Mission 2 but not pushing too hard to clear herself, which oddly made her more believable. She was somewhat passive in shaping late-game teams, which may have let evil narratives dominate the final decisions.",
        "Eve": "Played a very persuasive Mordred, often speaking like a methodical good player focused on \u2018data\u2019 from missions, which made her presence on multiple teams feel justified. She positioned herself close to Grace and Alice\u2019s apparent logic, creating a pseudo-good core that masked her evil alignment deep into the game.",
        "Frank": "As Merlin, he did a good job avoiding obvious hard pushes on the right evil players, but at times his caution made his reads feel a bit too generic and non-committal. His quiet trust patterns (who he consistently soft-approved or side-eyed) were subtle but not strong enough to steer the table away from the final bad team.",
        "Grace": "Played a very active, engaged Percival who looked distinctly good from early on, especially after setting up a plausible \u2018Merlin/decoy\u2019 pairing with Alice/Frank. However, her strong, confident table presence sometimes made it easier for evil to just blend into her preferred narrative rather than forcing them to defend themselves more directly."
