        "Alice": "Played in a straightforward and generally trusting way, often willing to go on teams and not overreacting to early fails. Seemed more focused on team-track logic than on deep role deduction, which made her feel like a solid but not overly paranoid good player.",
        "Bob": "Tended to anchor on mission results and track records, looking at patterns over time rather than social reads. His late-game leadership showed a willingness to take a stand, but he appeared somewhat swayable by table consensus.",
        "Charlie": "Did a strong job as Mordred, blending in as a reliable early pick and helping set up believable fail patterns on Missions 2 and 3. Managed to look consistently reasonable and not overly defensive, which helped keep the heat off the evil team.",
        "Diana": "As Merlin, she played carefully and didn\u2019t come off as loudly directive, which made her identity harder to pin down. Her influence on team choices felt subtly guiding rather than overt, which was good for staying alive but also made the Merlin signal fainter.",
        "Eve": "As Morgana, projected a Merlin-like presence at key moments, contributing to confusion about the true source of good information. Joined the failing Mission 3 in a way that kept multiple narratives open, helping cloud the read on who actually knew what.",
        "Frank": "As Percival, he seemed actively engaged in reading the table but not entirely sure how to interpret the Merlin/Morgana signals. His protection of who he thought was Merlin was noticeable but not loud enough to give away his own role clearly.",
        "Grace": "N/A",
        "Henry": "Came across as very \u2018villager-y\u2019 and pragmatic, often willing to be on teams and judge mainly by mission outcomes. His relative openness and lack of tricky behavior made him seem reliably good, which both helped his team trust him and made him a low-priority suspect for evil."

      "self_assessment": "I stayed consistently on early teams and tried to read patterns from the mission results, but I didn\u2019t adjust loudly or forcefully enough once it became clear that repeated fails were coming from the same core group. I should have been more suspicious of Charlie after Mission 2 and pushed much harder to exclude that early trio from later teams, especially once Mission 3 double-failed.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Tended to trust the early mission group and showed a bias toward reusing known teammates, which helped evil hide inside familiar teams. Her leadership on Mission 4 was cautious but still included at least one evil, relying on prior patterns more than hard logic.",
        "Bob": "Played fairly conservatively and seemed to value consensus, stepping into leadership late and choosing a team that looked \u2018balanced\u2019 rather than aggressively pruning out earlier suspicious links. His final mission team showed that he trusted social reads more than mission-result math.",
        "Charlie": "Played a very controlled evil game, taking the single fail on Mission 2 and then contributing to the double-fail on Mission 3 in a way that framed the whole early core (including me) as suspicious. He used the trust from Mission 1 well and never appeared overly defensive.",
        "Diana": "As Merlin, she navigated carefully, allowing some early damage but steering Mission 4 to a clean success that subtly included only one evil who chose to pass. Her decisions suggested she was trying to protect her identity by not over-pushing specific accusations.",
        "Eve": "Played an assertive, high-impact evil role by joining Mission 3 and helping cause the double-fail that maximized confusion. Her presence there made that mission look chaotic enough that blame could be spread widely instead of focusing tightly on Charlie.",
        "Frank": "As Percival, he seemed cautious about outing his information, not strongly hard-clearing or hard-accusing people, which kept Merlin relatively safe but also reduced the pressure on the real evils. His voting and team preferences felt more like a careful good player than a loud information-holder.",
        "Grace": "Played a very patient assassin, passing on Mission 4 to appear trustworthy and set up the final mission. The single fail on Mission 5 showed she timed her move well, capitalizing on the trust she\u2019d built by earlier restraint."
