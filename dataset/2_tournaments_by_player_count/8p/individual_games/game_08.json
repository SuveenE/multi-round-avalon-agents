        "Eve": "Did an excellent job as Morgana by embedding herself on early teams and providing just a single fail each time to avoid overexposure.

Being on multiple failing teams but still trusted enough to make Mission 4 shows she managed the social dynamics effectively and projected just enough apparent cooperation.",
