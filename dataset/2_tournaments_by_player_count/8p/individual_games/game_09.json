By building a team of Alice and me (Bob) from the proven early structure, then adding Frank and Grace (who have not yet appeared on any failing missions), and Henry (who was on both a success and the single-fail mission but is not entangled with the double-fail D/E pair), we exclude all of Charlie, Diana, and Eve\u2014the three most structurally implicated by the combination of the Mission 3 and Mission 4 results.

      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Played very earnestly and looked quite genuinely good, especially early, which made it hard to separate her from Percival and the real power roles; she trusted too many people late, which evil capitalized on.",
        "Bob": "As Percival, he seemed to be juggling multiple Merlin candidates and didn\u2019t commit hard enough to protecting the real Merlin line; his mid-game reads had good instincts but weren\u2019t translated into strong table influence.",
        "Charlie": "Very effective as Morgana, maintaining a consistent semi-trustworthy image through early successes and using that credibility to slide onto critical teams; managed suspicion well without over-defending.",
        "Diana": "Played a quiet but sharp Assassin, letting others drive most of the discussion and then using the accumulated social reads to make a solid endgame call; didn\u2019t overreach, which kept her under the radar.",
        "Eve": "Played straightforwardly good and was generally logical in team evaluation, but was a bit too willing to follow table momentum instead of challenging risky compositions.",
        "Frank": "Came across as very clearly good but didn\u2019t leverage that clarity enough to steer team selection; tended to defer more than drive when it mattered most.",
        "Grace": "Did a strong job as Mordred by staying in the mid-trust zone\u2014never the loudest, but consistently acceptable on teams; benefited from blending in with the more cautious good voices."
