        "Charlie": "As Percival, seemed genuinely conflicted about the Merlin signals, which made his pushes feel cautious rather than decisive; that caution late made it easier for evil to sneak into Mission 5.",
        "Diana": "Blended in very well as evil by not taking early risks and only appearing on the final critical mission, which made the single fail there feel more ambiguous and hard to pin purely on her.",
        "Eve": "Came across as a very reasonable good player, especially by being absent from the first failed mission and then present on a later failing one in a way that didn\u2019t strongly incriminate her, but could have argued more strongly to repeat safer cores.",
        "Frank": "Played a quiet but very effective Mordred game; slipping onto Mission 4 for a single fail without drawing overwhelming backlash set up a lot of late-game confusion about whether the problem was him or a previously trusted player.",
        "Grace": "As Assassin, she leveraged her early presence on successful teams to look clean, then used that trust to slip a fail onto a midgame mission without getting fully locked out afterwards.",
        "Henry": "As Merlin, he walked a fine line between steering teams toward safer options and not over-telegraphing his knowledge; his subtlety kept him alive information-wise but also left just enough ambiguity for evil to assemble the final winning team."

        "Grace": "You played an aggressive, involved evil game and were on the pivotal Mission 3 fail without getting instantly hard-cleared as bad. Your talkative style created enough noise that it was harder for good to cleanly isolate where the information was coming from, though you could have leaned even more into a Merlin-like posture to mislead Charlie.",
        "Henry": "You had strong, accurate reads typical of Merlin and guided early team selections well, especially in getting clean early missions.
