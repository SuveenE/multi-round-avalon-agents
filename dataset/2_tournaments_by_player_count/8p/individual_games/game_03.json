There are exactly two evils here, so we need to avoid them.\n- Eve and Diana both feel more suspect: they were on the double-fail mission and are each arguing themselves as preferable picks in a way that can be read as positioning.\n- Bob and Henry are more broadly treated as the \"less bad\" options: multiple players independently floated Bob as the safest from that set; Frank (despite my suspicion of him) tagged Henry as his least-bad option; Henry\u2019s own structure of wanting {Alice, Grace, Charlie} is consistent with a good read of the core, even if self-advocacy is NAI.\nGiven limited information and needing two from this pool, the best odds alignment-wise is to assume the evils here are {Diana, Eve} and therefore select Bob and Henry as the likely goods.\n\nResult: Team = {Alice, Bob, Charlie, Grace, Henry}, built on (1) excluding the most suspicious core member (Frank) and (2) taking the two least-suspected members from the mission 3 group (Bob, Henry) under the constraint that exactly two in that group are evil.",

        "Bob": "As Percival, he seemed to be probing and watching reactions more than driving, which fits someone trying to track Merlin vs Morgana. His influence felt subtle rather than loud, but it wasn\u2019t enough to prevent evil from steering key mission compositions.",
        "Charlie": "As Merlin, he appeared cautious and not too forceful, likely trying not to get assassinated, but that restraint meant his reads didn\u2019t fully reshape our team choices. His presence on the failed Mission 2 made it harder to distinguish who was actually responsible for the fail.",
        "Eve": "As Morgana, she set up early trust well by leading a clean first mission that included an evil player yet still succeeded, which gave her teams credibility. Her positioning and social presence helped obscure where the real information and danger were coming from.",
        "Frank": "As Mordred, he leveraged the clean first mission to appear trustworthy and then slipped in a single fail on Mission 2 to create confusion without overexposing himself. His continued presence on later teams, including my Mission 4, shows how effectively he maintained that false sense of reliability.",
        "Grace": "Grace\u2019s early inclusion on a successful mission and then leadership of the double-fail Mission 3 put her in a confusing spot, but her overall behavior still felt more consistent with a good player making risky or unlucky picks. She seemed to trust too widely, which evil exploited.",
        "Henry": "As Assassin, he managed to stay relatively under the radar while still getting onto two critical failing missions (3 and 4), which is exactly where evil needed him. His lower profile meant he wasn\u2019t heavily scrutinized despite being on multiple bad outcomes."

        "Bob": "As Percival, he clearly tried to read between Charlie and me, often deferring to stronger table consensus instead of forcing his own Merlin-read. His caution helped evil because he didn\u2019t hard-clear or hard-push either of us, leaving ambiguity about who was Merlin.",
        "Charlie": "As Merlin, he guided missions subtly rather than with loud, domineering control, which made his reads look like \u2018good instincts\u2019 instead of confirmed information.

        "Frank": "As Mordred, he blended very well with the logical core of the table, especially around Missions 1 and 2, using reasonable arguments that matched how a thoughtful good player would talk. He avoided overclaiming influence, which kept his alignment opaque and let him be included on critical teams.",
        "Grace": "Grace came across as flexible and cooperative, often open to being on teams and adjusting based on others\u2019 arguments instead of strongly anchoring her own narratives.
