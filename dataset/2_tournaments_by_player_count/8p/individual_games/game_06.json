Gave just enough reasoning to seem cooperative without over-explaining, which helped keep attention off him as a key evil.",
        "Grace": "Looked quite good and was willing to be on larger, riskier teams, which suggested comfort and trust in the table\u2019s reads. Didn\u2019t seem to strongly resist being put on mission 4 despite the stakes, which made her a safe inclusion from evil\u2019s perspective.",
        "Henry": "Played a very calm and composed Merlin, guiding team selections and reads in a way that felt natural but not overly forceful. His consistency across missions helped him avoid the appearance of \u2018magical\u2019 knowledge, but he was still accurate enough that evil could eventually triangulate him as the hidden information source."

        "Henry": "As Merlin, did a good job not being too obvious, but at times their caution about certain players wasn\u2019t forcefully articulated enough to clearly steer the table away from stacked-evil teams."

However, I could have been more vocal about pushing for tighter, information-rich team compositions and questioning the logic behind repeating certain players on failing teams. In future games, I should press harder on pointing out pattern-based suspicions earlier instead of assuming others will connect those dots.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Played a very active, central role and used her influence as Percival to confidently push narratives, which made her seem naturally trustworthy even when some team choices were risky. She tends to lean into strong, assertive table talk that can steer others\u2019 perceptions.",
        "Bob": "Stayed just cautious enough to avoid standing out too much, then used Mission 4 to land a decisive blow with a double-fail setup. He appears comfortable taking a leadership role when it really matters, even if he\u2019s been quieter earlier.",
        "Charlie": "Flew relatively under the radar and didn\u2019t strongly anchor team discussions, which made it hard to get a clear read on him. His low-key style is safe as good, but also doesn\u2019t generate as much helpful information.",
        "Diana": "Blended in well with the good players while subtly supporting lines that protected other evil roles. She\u2019s good at sounding reasonable and constructive, which makes her misdirection harder to challenge in the moment.",
        "Eve": "Seemed naturally trustworthy and cooperative, which aligned with her actual good role, but her presence on early successful and later failing teams made things confusing. She tends to project calm confidence, which can both help and unintentionally shield evil teammates.",
        "Frank": "Managed to get onto a failing mission without drawing decisive blame, suggesting a talent for framing his participation as circumstantial rather than suspicious. He often positions his comments as measured and logical, which helps him avoid heat as evil.",
        "Henry": "Did a solid job as Merlin at subtly nudging suspicions without overcommitting, but the table didn\u2019t fully capitalize on his hints. His style leans toward quiet, reasoned input rather than loud accusations, which is strong but risks being overlooked in chaotic discussions."

She seemed to balance trust-building with subtle role-protection, but her pushes could have been framed more decisively against the actual evils.",
        "Bob": "Played a relatively low-key game as Assassin, which made it harder for good to confidently frame him as evil despite his presence on the final failing mission. His conservative social footprint kept him from being a focal point of accusation, which paid off in the endgame.",

        "Diana": "As Morgana, she sold herself well as a potential Merlin/strong good read, making it harder for Percival and others to cleanly separate our roles. She leaned into being included on teams without over-defensiveness, which helped her slide onto critical failing missions.",
        "Eve": "As leader on Mission 1, she built early trust with a clean success and maintained a generally good, cooperative image. Her willingness to go on teams and avoid over-claiming information kept her from being a major suspect, but she also didn\u2019t strongly disrupt evil narratives.",
        "Frank": "Played Mordred in a way that kept him from being locked as evil even after a fail on his team, likely by sharing suspicion and not over-pushing any single narrative. His positioning in mid-game missions and measured talk made it harder for me to steer the table solidly against him.",
        "Grace": "Came across as quite genuinely good in table talk and team voting, which matched her actual role and helped keep her trusted. However, her influence didn\u2019t fully convert into strong resistance against the final failing composition, so her trust wasn\u2019t leveraged to maximum effect."
