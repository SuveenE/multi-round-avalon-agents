She didn\u2019t strongly drive suspicion toward the actual evil players, which made her a relatively safe presence for us to keep on teams.",
        "Charlie": "Charlie played a fairly straightforward good game, getting onto the critical Mission 2 and Mission 4 teams but not creating strong, persuasive reads that changed the table\u2019s direction. Their involvement in a failed Mission 4 without clearly outing the evil combinations helped preserve ambiguity.",

Her appearance on the final failing mission alongside multiple others helped maintain doubt about who the true Merlin/evil mix was.",
        "Frank": "As Merlin, Frank played cautiously, guiding mission selections away from obvious danger early (Mission 1) but not forcefully enough later to prevent stacking evil on key missions. His subtlety kept him from being an obvious assassination target, but it also meant his good team didn\u2019t fully capitalize on his information.",
        "Grace": "As Percival, Grace didn\u2019t strongly clarify the Morgana/Merlin identity puzzle for the table; her presence on Mission 3, which failed, added to the noise rather than cleaning it up. She seemed to struggle to translate her partial information into persuasive arguments that the rest of the table would follow.",

His team choices, though, ended up including multiple evil players in the final mission, suggesting he either overtrusted or didn\u2019t push hard enough on his suspicions."

        "Henry": "Played a relatively open and collaborative good style, contributing to discussions without trying to dominate them.

His willingness to be on repeated critical teams created strong swing potential but also risked drawing late-game suspicion if the game had gone to an assassination decision.",

Your early presence on both a success and a later fail without being heavily questioned suggests you\u2019re good at blending into the background of team discussions.",
        "Bob": "You were frequently included on teams despite being evil, which means your table talk and reactions were convincing and non-threatening. The big spike of fails on Mission 4 with you on the team shows you were willing to take bold risks once evil had enough cover.",
