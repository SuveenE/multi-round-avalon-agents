That makes Bob and Frank the best anchors. Alice is the only player on both failed missions (3 and 4), which makes her the single most suspicious player; she should be excluded. Mission 4\u2019s fail came from among {Alice, Diana, Eve, Grace, Henry}. If Alice is evil, then Diana, Eve, Grace, and Henry can all still be good; even if Alice is actually good, at most one of Diana/Eve/Grace/Henry is evil because only one fail appeared. The broad table consensus (from Charlie, Diana, Eve, Henry) converged on a core of Bob/Frank/Diana/Henry as the safest four. Between the remaining candidates for the fifth slot (Eve vs. Grace vs. Charlie vs. re-adding Alice), Eve is least tied to previous fails: Charlie is tied to the Mission 3 fail, Grace to the Mission 4 fail and to the Mission 2 spy pool, and Alice is tied to both fails. Therefore, the team Bob, Frank, Diana, Henry, and Eve uses the best-info core, removes the double-overlap Alice, avoids Charlie/Grace who are each connected to one of the fails, and aligns with the majority\u2019s preferred structure for the final mission.",

I should have pressed harder on the pattern of Bob/Frank/Charlie/Henry being over-represented on critical missions and been more skeptical when Mission 3 failed. As leader on Mission 4, I could have tightened my team selection more aggressively around the most consistently clean players instead of spreading risk.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Bob": "Bob appeared consistently trustworthy by being on the first two successful missions, which made it easy to clear him mentally and likely made evil comfortable hiding next to him. He didn\u2019t strongly challenge later team compositions, which indirectly let evil shape Missions 3 and 5 without heavy resistance.",
        "Charlie": "Charlie slipped smoothly onto the successful Mission 2 and then onto the failing Mission 3, using that early success to mask his role as Mordred. He played a low-profile, quietly-included style that avoided drawing attention even after the first fail, which was effective at keeping suspicion spread out.",
        "Diana": "As Percival and the final mission leader, Diana tried to balance information with team selection but ended up including two evil players on Mission 5. Her team choices suggested she was partially misreading Merlin\u2019s signals or over-trusting certain players who had been on mixed-result missions. She played actively and took on responsibility, but her late-game read was just off enough to swing the result.",
        "Eve": "Eve maintained enough ambiguity to get onto the crucial Mission 4 and then the final Mission 5, contributing to both fails as the Assassin. She didn\u2019t need to be heavily vocal; her value came from blending into mid-trust territory and riding along with more central figures like Diana and Henry. Her positioning on the last mission was especially decisive.",
        "Frank": "As Merlin, Frank did an excellent job getting on early clean teams and quietly steering Missions 1 and 2 toward success. However, his later influence wasn\u2019t strong enough to keep multiple evils off Missions 3\u20135, suggesting he was being careful not to be too obvious and may have erred on the side of subtlety. His play looked consistently good-aligned from my perspective, which means he succeeded at looking trustworthy but not at fully converting that into safe endgame teams.",
        "Grace": "Grace led Mission 2 and selected a fully good team, which strongly increased her perceived reliability and mine. After that, she stayed relatively low-drama, which kept her away from heavy suspicion but also limited her late impact on steering away from bad teams. Her conservative, solid early pick helped evil later because it gave us a false sense of security in the pool of players that followed.",
        "Henry": "Henry, as Morgana, successfully embedded himself on key mid- and late-game missions (3, 4, and 5), contributing to the chain of fails while never becoming the clear consensus suspect. His willingness to sit on mixed teams and exploit the confusion around Merlin/percival reads made him look like a reasonable inclusion rather than a glaring risk. He was central to evil\u2019s success by consistently being on pivotal missions without drawing enough heat to be locked out."

I should have been more suspicious of Charlie after Mission 3 and more vocal against adding both Henry and Eve to the final team.",

        "Alice": "Led a safe first mission and generally projected a solid good vibe, but didn\u2019t manage to force a consensus around a clearly good pool later in the game. Tended to play a bit cautiously, which made it harder to counter the coordinated evil moves.",
        "Charlie": "Played a very patient evil game by passing Mission 2 to build strong trust, then striking on Mission 3 at a critical moment. Blended in well with the good team and leveraged that early success to stay off the main suspect list for too long.",
        "Diana": "As Percival, Diana tried to steer the endgame but ended up with both Henry and Eve on the final team, suggesting uncertainty about Merlin\u2019s identity. Showed willingness to take responsibility by leading Mission 5, but the team composition was too risky.",
        "Eve": "Assassin play was subtle, staying low-impact early (no fails on Missions 1 or 2) and only revealing full aggression on Mission 5 with a double fail. Worked well with Henry to apply just enough pressure on Missions 4 and 5 without drawing clear suspicion earlier.",
        "Frank": "As Merlin, Frank did a good job guiding early mission success and staying alive, but his signals weren\u2019t strong or clear enough to prevent evil from getting onto the last mission. His play looked convincingly good without being blatantly directional, which protected him but also left some ambiguity for the rest of us.",
        "Grace": "Led a clean Mission 2 that helped establish an early trust network, and generally came across as straightforward good. However, wasn\u2019t able to translate that trust into decisive influence over the critical late-game team selections.",
        "Henry": "As Morgana, Henry played an excellent deceptive role, staying quiet enough early and then participating in the key failing missions (4 and 5). Managed to get onto the final team despite prior involvement in a fail, indicating strong social positioning and effective misdirection."

I could have been more proactive in subtly steering teams toward including at least one other evil player earlier, rather than relying so much on later mission chaos. Overall, my Mordred value was realized because Merlin never had clean leverage against me, but I can improve at more active narrative shaping.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "You played very straightforwardly good and took a big swing on Mission 4 with a wide team, which ended up injecting a lot of ambiguity into who the spy was. Your willingness to include multiple middling-suspicion players made it harder for good to narrow things down.",
        "Bob": "You gravitated toward familiar, early-trusted players (especially reusing Frank) and tended to anchor on earlier mission results when evaluating later teams. That consistency made you look very village-like but also a bit exploitable, since evil could predict which cores you\u2019d be comfortable with.",
        "Diana": "As Percival, you seemed cautious and hesitant to hard-clear or hard-push anyone, which kept Merlin somewhat protected but also limited your impact on team direction. Your final mission team choice showed you were still spread on suspects, giving evil the opening they needed.",
        "Eve": "You blended in well on table talk and then timed your mission fails effectively, especially on Missions 4 and 5 where your presence kept good guessing between multiple suspects. As Assassin, you benefited a lot from the confusion around Henry and me, preserving a thick cloud of doubt.",
        "Frank": "As Merlin, you clearly had good instincts about some evils but never fully pinned me down, which shows Mordred\u2019s effect was working. Your tendency to stay within socially plausible suspicion ranges (not pushing too hard on specific people) kept you safe but also reduced pressure on the actual spies.",
        "Grace": "You came across as solidly good and trustworthy, and your Mission 2 leadership with a clean result helped set a baseline of trust for several players. Later, you didn\u2019t strongly dictate direction, which let louder voices carry the final missions in ways that helped evil.",
        "Henry": "You leaned into the Morgana ambiguity nicely, becoming a natural lightning rod once Mission 4 failed with you on it. Your participation in the double-fail on Mission 5 sealed the game and capitalized on the existing suspicion that had already been building your way."

Her leadership on Mission 4 seemed more about covering bases than pushing a strong theory, which made it easier for evil to slip onto the team.",
        "Bob": "Tended to trust prior successful teams heavily, which made him slow to revise reads even after Mission 3 failed. His willingness to repeatedly go with similar cores gave evil a comfortable structure to hide in.",
        "Charlie": "As Mordred, blended into the background well and avoided drawing direct heat, especially after Mission 3\u2019s fail where suspicion could have turned toward him more strongly. He let others drive major arguments, which helped keep his own alignment relatively opaque.",

        "Frank": "As Merlin, he guided team selection subtly rather than loudly, nudging toward safer configurations without over-claiming certainty, which was good discipline. However, his slight pattern of de-prioritizing specific evil players on critical teams gave just enough of a trail for me to identify him as Merlin in the end.",
        "Grace": "Played straightforwardly good, generally following logical voting patterns and not overcomplicating the read structure. Her Mission 2 leadership was conservative and reasonable, which helped build trust in her but also reassured evil that we could pass early without much scrutiny.",
