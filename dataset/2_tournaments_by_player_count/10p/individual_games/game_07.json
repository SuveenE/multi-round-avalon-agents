For the fifth slot, Bob is the only player who has not yet been on any mission, and multiple players have argued that if we\u2019re going to add someone, it should be totally fresh info rather than someone tied to the Mission 2 fail. Including Bob maximizes information gain while keeping Grace off the team after the Mission 2 failure that only differed by including her. This team aligns with the majority of the expressed preferences in discussion and uses our best double-clean core plus a single new, high-information addition.",

        "Bob": "Bob as Morgana leaned heavily into looking like a careful, logic-based good player, often mirroring good reasoning but bending conclusions just enough to protect evil. His low-key style made him a very plausible Merlin/percival candidate, which successfully muddy the waters.",
        "Diana": "Diana as Oberon stayed relatively detached from the main logic debates, which kept her from being a focal point of suspicion or trust. Her low coordination with other players fit her role but also meant she didn\u2019t strongly affect mission direction.",

She kept a reasonable, non-theatrical presence that didn\u2019t scream assassin, which gave her space to observe and make an accurate endgame shot.",
        "Frank": "Frank played a low-impact but solidly good-looking game, rarely pushing extreme positions and instead echoing broadly safe consensus. That conservative style made him feel trustworthy but also meant he wasn\u2019t a major driver in catching evil.",
        "Grace": "Grace as Mordred blended well by not over-asserting herself, instead nudging team compositions just enough to keep evil in plausible spots. She avoided creating big contradictions, which kept her from becoming an obvious target even around the failed mission.",
        "Henry": "Henry as Percival signaled some protective behavior toward the players he thought might be Merlin, occasionally defending them a bit too cleanly. His reads suggested he was juggling multiple Merlin candidates, which helped but may have incidentally increased the assassin\u2019s focus on me.",
        "Iris": "Iris presented as very team-oriented and agreeable, which made her feel like a safe include on missions, especially after participating in successful ones. She didn\u2019t force many strong, independent reads, which kept her from drawing suspicion but also limited her role in exposing evil coordination.",
        "Jack": "Jack felt like a background good, contributing occasional comments without trying to dominate strategy or theory. That quieter style kept him almost entirely off everyone\u2019s radar, which is great for survival but reduces his influence on mission outcomes."

        "Grace": "As Mordred, she took a key risk by being on the failed Mission 2, then managed the aftermath well enough that suspicion stayed spread out and never fully locked on her. Her presence on the failing mission without becoming the permanent scapegoat was a big part of evil\u2019s success.",
        "Henry": "As Percival, he did well at appearing generally trustworthy but may have signaled his Merlin read a bit too clearly through how he followed Charlie. His alignment seemed good to most, but that connection probably helped evil narrow down the Merlin candidates.",
