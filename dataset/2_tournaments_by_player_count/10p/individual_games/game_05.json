I did well staying generally consistent with my voting and arguments so I didn't look chaotic, but I need to be bolder about calling out suspicious patterns and pushing for cleaner, more information-rich team comps earlier.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Very good at looking structurally \"safe\"\u2014being on mission 1\u2019s success and then blending into larger teams made her feel like default-good even after later fails. She leveraged that early trust to stay off the radar as Mordred, especially since Merlin couldn\u2019t see her.",
        "Bob": "Played Morgana in a way that likely made them look like a strong information-holder, creating plausible confusion with Merlin. Tended to sit in a mid-accusation zone\u2014suspicious but always with just enough logic to avoid being cleanly excluded.",
        "Charlie": "As Oberon, their voting and team opinions probably looked a bit off-tempo, which was hard to read as either clueless good or disconnected evil. Their presence on the failed mission 3 and 4 teams added noise without clearly outing them, which is strong for hidden evil.",
        "Diana": "Came across as fairly trustworthy and willing to go on multiple missions, which is solid for a good player trying to generate information. Might benefit from being a bit louder about pushing people they distrust off critical later missions.",
        "Frank": "Being on the successful mission 1 and then on the failed mission 2 with multiple fail cards made Frank a tricky read\u2014looked like either a framed good or a quiet evil. Tended to play a low-key style, which is helpful for good when honest but can also make it harder for others to clear them decisively.",
        "Grace": "As Merlin, Grace did a good job not being obviously loud or reckless, which likely kept her alive for the assassin shot, but perhaps erred slightly on the side of subtlety. Her team selections and votes suggested some underlying info, yet not enough hard pushes to flip the table away from hidden evil.",
        "Henry": "As a good player leading mission 2, Henry put together a risky lineup that gave a lot of information but also handed evil a big early win with two fail cards. His choices felt logically structured, but he could improve by more aggressively revising reads after such a strong signal of multiple evils on his team.",
        "Iris": "As Percival, Iris had the tough job of sorting between Grace and Bob, and their leadership on mission 3 ended up with a failed team that included at least one evil. They seemed to trust their Merlin read somewhat but not decisively enough to anchor good\u2019s consensus around the right core.",
        "Jack": "As Assassin, Jack stayed just credible enough to be included on the crucial mission 4 team while not drawing overwhelming suspicion earlier. Their endgame positioning and final read on Merlin were strong, capitalizing well on the confusion sown by Morgana and Mordred."

        "Bob": "Played a strong partnered-evil role by blending in as a reasonable voice and not over-defending Alice, which made both of them harder to nail together. Tends to present logical-sounding arguments that slightly misdirect without being obviously agenda-driven.",
        "Charlie": "Low-information, somewhat chaotic presence that made it harder to read alignment; this fit Oberon well because the confusion he created benefited evil. Often stayed just outside the center of logic-heavy discussions, which let him avoid tight scrutiny.",
        "Diana": "Played a very solid, steady good game and maintained a consistent tone that should have earned more trust earlier. Willing to go on risky teams when needed, which is good for progress but makes her slightly harder to hard-clear if others aren\u2019t tracking patterns carefully.",
        "Eve": "Came across as generally sincere and collaborative, especially in mid-game discussions. Sometimes deferred a bit too much to stronger voices, which let evil narratives persist longer than they should have.",
        "Grace": "As Merlin, did a good job not over-signaling but at times may have been too subtle in steering away from the evil cluster around Alice/Bob. Voting patterns and soft nudges made sense in hindsight but weren\u2019t quite strong enough to overcome table uncertainty.",
        "Henry": "Played like a straightforward good player, but his presence on the double-fail team made him an unfortunate collateral suspect. Tends to argue from immediate mission results rather than overarching role interactions, which can make him both convincing and misled.",
        "Iris": "As Percival, seemed genuinely torn between Grace and Bob/Alice at times, which is understandable given how well evil masked their roles. Tried to use voting and team preferences to resolve the Merlin identity but didn\u2019t fully translate those reads into strong table pushes.",
        "Jack": "As Assassin, stayed reasonably controlled and avoided being the primary focus of suspicion until late, which gave evil space to maneuver. On Mission 4, leaned into the fail outcome effectively to close the game and capitalize on the confusion already created."

        "Bob": "Played a classic Morgana game by pairing with Alice and Henry on Mission 2 and hiding in the noise of a 4-person team with a double-fail; pattern suggests he likes being on pivotal mid-game missions where blame can be spread widely.",
        "Charlie": "As Oberon, created quiet chaos by being present on the crucial losing missions (3 and 4) without obvious coordination, which made his alignment harder to pin down and clouded team reads.",

        "Eve": "Played a low-key good game, joining mid/late missions (3 and 4) that failed, which unintentionally made her look like a possible coordinated evil; her style suggests she\u2019s fine being a quiet, flexible pick rather than forcing herself into leadership.",
        "Frank": "Despite being good and on both M1 (success) and M2 (double fail), he didn\u2019t clearly project his perspective afterward, which let evil use the ambiguity around that mission to their advantage; tends to play more reactively than proactively.",
        "Henry": "As a good leader on Mission 2, he took a risky, broad team that included both Alice and Bob, which opened the door for a heavy evil presence; he seems comfortable making bold, information-generating choices, even when they\u2019re exploitable by evil.",
        "Iris": "As Percival, she had a hard job distinguishing Merlin from Morgana given how the information played out around Missions 2 and 3; her mission 3 proposal shows she\u2019s proactive and willing to commit to a read even under uncertainty.",
        "Jack": "As Assassin, he steered the late-game by putting together Mission 4\u2019s failing team, mixing good and evil well; his leadership shows a preference for high-impact, high-variance decisions and he capitalized on the confusion to secure the win."

Her calm presence and willingness to be on multiple mixed teams made her look generically good instead of specifically suspicious.",
        "Bob": "Played Morgana aggressively but in a controlled way, often sounding like a 'helpful analyst' and subtly reinforcing suspicion on good players. His presence on the Mission 2 fail should have been a bigger red flag, but he blended his arguments well with the general table consensus.",
        "Charlie": "As Oberon, his slightly off-beat reads and occasional contradictions made him look like a confused good player rather than coordinated evil. I discounted his weirdness as inexperience/noise instead of recognizing that he didn\u2019t line up cleanly with any consistent good-world.",
        "Diana": "Looked suspicious to me mostly because she appeared on multiple failing missions, but her tone and logic were generally transparent and good-leaning. I should have weighted her mission 3 and 4 behavior (pushing reasonable teams and reactions to fails) more than simple team overlap.",
        "Eve": "Played a straightforward, earnest good style, but I kept misreading her caution as possible evil hedging. Her reactions after mission fails were very consistent with a good player trying to puzzle things out, which I underappreciated in real time.",
        "Frank": "Got heavily tied to my suspicions after the Mission 2 double-fail, partly because he was quiet at key points and didn\u2019t strongly defend alternative worldviews. In hindsight, his lack of sharp agenda and his willingness to be sidelined from later teams was more consistent with confused good than with confident evil.",
        "Grace": "As Merlin, she walked a careful line but sometimes got overruled or drowned out when evil narratives gained momentum. I misread her occasional hesitancy as uncertainty instead of as a Merlin trying not to over-direct, and I didn\u2019t give her enough weight in team selection.",
        "Iris": "As Percival, she had some good directional pushes but didn\u2019t get enough buy-in from the table, and I didn\u2019t trust her reads as strongly as I should have. When she and Grace were roughly aligned, that should have anchored me more firmly against the actual evil core.",
        "Jack": "As Assassin, he positioned himself as a central, reasonable voice late game, and I let his confident framing sway me too much. His role in building or approving failing teams was clearer in hindsight, but in the moment his assertiveness read as leadership rather than manipulation."
