Her style felt methodical but not domineering, which made it easier for evil to hide in the ambiguity she helped create.",

        "Grace": "As the final mission leader, she appeared to trust a core of players (including multiple evils) enough to put them on the deciding team, suggesting she relied heavily on accumulated social trust and partially-misread mission data. Her playstyle seemed collaborative and open, which unfortunately made it easier for evil to sneak into that last lineup.",

His repeated presence on both a clean success and later failing teams shows he was trusted, but he didn\u2019t fully leverage that trust to lock out suspected evils from the final missions.",
        "Iris": "As Merlin, she stayed quite subtle, not forcefully driving team composition despite having strong information, which helped her survive but also left room for evil to win on mission outcomes. Her reads appeared to influence trust patterns somewhat, but not enough to form a tight confirmed-good bloc that could consistently exclude the hidden evils.",

        "Charlie": "As an early leader, you helped set the tone of the game with a clean Mission 1, but that early trust in you ended up being a bit deceptive in terms of who we let orbit those teams later. You seem comfortable taking initiative early and then fading slightly into the background when the table state gets more complex.",

Your ability to ride the ambiguity around Alice/Morgana and Merlin reads made it much harder for good to coordinate well.",

She blended into the midpack of trust rather than trying to be the loudest voice, which is often the most convincing fake-Merlin approach.",
        "Bob": "Played a straightforward, low-drama good game and felt mechanically clean on the all-good Mission 3 team. However, he could have pushed his reads more assertively in the late game when the pool of likely evils should have been narrower.",
        "Charlie": "As good, Charlie\u2019s early inclusion on successful Mission 1 gave them passive credibility, and they didn\u2019t overuse that social capital, which helped them stay broadly trusted. They could improve by more explicitly walking through their team-building logic so others can coordinate better around their reads.",
        "Diana": "Diana\u2019s leadership on Mission 2 ended in a brutal double-fail, but their reactions afterward felt genuinely conflicted rather than performative, which in hindsight was a good indicator of being good. There\u2019s room to tighten suspicion ranges after a fail\u2014especially being more systematic about who is mechanically cleared versus just socially cleared.",
        "Eve": "As the Assassin, Eve played a very controlled game: she stayed reasonably trustworthy through the clean Mission 3 team and didn\u2019t stand out as obviously evil despite later being on successful and failed missions. Her late-game positioning and apparent reasonableness made the evil win plausible and set up a strong endgame assassination threat.",
        "Frank": "Frank as Oberon managed to avoid sticking out as chaotic evil, which is impressive given Oberon\u2019s information disadvantage. That said, from my perspective their mid-game presence felt a bit murky and reactive, which ironically made them easier to park in a \u2018could be anything\u2019 bucket rather than a sharp evil read.",
        "Grace": "Grace\u2019s involvement in both a clean mission (3) and later a double-fail (5) created a confusing signal, and she navigated that ambiguity fairly well socially by not panicking under suspicion. She might benefit from being more explicit about who she refuses to team with after a fail to push the table toward better mechanical deductions.",
        "Iris": "As Merlin, Iris stayed impressively subtle, not over-clearing goods or hard-pushing on specific evils, which made it genuinely difficult for me as Percival to lock her in confidently over Morgana. She leaned into soft nudges rather than loud calls, which protected her but also made it harder for good to consolidate around her reads in crunch time.",
        "Jack": "Jack as Mordred played a convincing, mid-visibility role: involved enough in discussion to seem engaged, but not so central as to draw classic Merlin suspicion. His presence on the failing Mission 5 team was well-masked by broader chaos, showing good timing and awareness of table perception."

        "Alice": "Played Morgana in a way that blended well with village confusion, leveraging the Mission 2 fail to muddy suspicion between herself and other team members.",

        "Diana": "As leader on the first failed mission, absorbed some suspicion but handled it calmly, neither over-defensive nor aggressively accusatory, which kept her in a gray area for many.",
        "Eve": "Assassin play was subtle; participated in the early success and then the key fail, maintaining a low-to-medium profile that avoided making her the obvious kill target as non-Merlin.",
        "Frank": "As Oberon, introduced some unpredictable noise; his participation in a failing mission without clear coordination made reads around him and his teams more confusing.",
        "Grace": "Came across as analytical and proactive, and despite being good ended up on failing teams, which unintentionally helped evil by spreading doubt about her alignment.",
        "Henry": "As Percival, tried to track Merlin-like behavior but was somewhat misled by the Morgana/Merlin ambiguity, showing hesitation in fully trusting his strongest read.",
        "Jack": "Mordred play was low-key and effective; he avoided early exposure and only became more central on the final mission, where his presence helped secure the deciding fail."

      "self_assessment": "I stayed mostly under the radar as Mordred, letting the louder players and mission debates draw attention away from me, which helped evil reach three failed missions without my role being a central focus.

        "Alice": "Played Morgana convincingly by echoing reasonable logical takes, making it tougher to distinguish her from Merlin and adding noise around information-based reads.",
        "Bob": "Tended to play straightforwardly and trust mission history heavily, which made him slower to adjust when the narrative turned against good.",
        "Charlie": "Showed willingness to be on early teams and accept some risk, but didn\u2019t press hard enough later to re-evaluate assumptions after multiple fails.",
        "Diana": "Led with a collaborative tone and tried to build consensus, but this made her susceptible to being subtly steered by more assertive voices.",
        "Eve": "As Assassin, stayed relatively calm and non-flashy, avoiding the classic \"too tryhard\" evil vibe and helping preserve ambiguity for the assassination.",
        "Frank": "As Oberon, came off a bit disconnected from broader table logic, which actually helped create confusion and obscured the true evil configuration.",
        "Grace": "Played analytically, focusing on team composition patterns, but sometimes over-weighted small samples from earlier missions, leading to some mis-clears.",
        "Henry": "As Percival, clearly tried to track Merlin/Morgana signals but didn\u2019t hard-push a single narrative, which made his reads feel cautious and sometimes hard to follow for others.",
        "Iris": "As Merlin, did a good job not overcorrecting teams too aggressively, staying subtle enough that her knowledge wasn\u2019t glaringly obvious and keeping the assassin guess non-trivial."
