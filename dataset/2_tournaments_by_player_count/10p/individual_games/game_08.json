I could have contributed more by subtly shaping table talk and reads to amplify suspicion on strong good voices like Diana and Henry without drawing attention to myself.",

        "Charlie": "Came across as reasonably trustworthy but not forceful; was often included on teams without becoming a major focal point of suspicion or leadership.",
        "Diana": "As Merlin, her reads and quiet influence clearly helped steer some successful team decisions, but she stayed just ambiguous enough that evil could still land the win in the end.",
        "Frank": "As Percival, tried to protect the Merlin identity through his support patterns, but his reads and team choices didn\u2019t fully lock in the Merlin cover and left some ambiguity for evil to exploit.",
        "Grace": "As Assassin, managed her table image well enough to be on both a success and a fail team, keeping her role hidden while contributing to the decisive mission outcomes.",
        "Henry": "Looked solidly good through much of the game and was trusted enough to lead an important failing mission, which indicates evil did well at muddying his reads or surrounding him with the wrong teammates.",
        "Iris": "As an early leader, took on significant responsibility in mission 1 and the crucial mission 4; her team choices ended up giving evil leverage, suggesting she was misled by evil\u2019s subtle positioning.",
        "Jack": "As Morgana, did strong work sowing confusion about information roles and stayed viable for inclusion on a critical mission, helping maintain uncertainty around who the true information holders were."

      "self_assessment": "I correctly focused on the Merlin/Morgana pair early but didn\u2019t adjust fast enough when mission results started to implicate Bob and therefore exonerate Diana\u2019s judgment somewhat. I also didn\u2019t communicate my Merlin read clearly enough through my votes and table talk, which helped evil steer suspicion and ultimately get the assassination right.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Played a solid, low-profile good game; being on two failing teams without obvious defensive reactions made you look ambiguously aligned and hard to clear or condemn.",
        "Bob": "Very effective as Mordred, blending into mid-pack suspicion and using the single-fail missions to create shared blame without overexposing yourself.",
        "Charlie": "Came across as consistently reasonable and good-leaning, with mission approvals and table presence that made you a natural anchor for multiple teams.",
        "Diana": "As Merlin you took some risky team compositions that included Bob, but you masked foreknowledge well enough that I doubted you at key points instead of locking you in as true Merlin.",
        "Eve": "Extremely quiet and off-center as Oberon, which minimized the information town could extract from you and kept you from being a focal point of discussion.",
        "Grace": "Very convincing social presence as Assassin, using early mission involvement and the clean Mission 2 to look collaborative and trustworthy until late game.",
        "Henry": "Felt like sincere good: your reactions to Mission 1\u2019s fail and later team discussions were emotionally consistent, even if they didn\u2019t strongly move the needle on solving.",
        "Iris": "Your leadership on the last mission you led felt genuinely conflicted and open, which read as good to me even though the resulting team composition didn\u2019t resolve the game in our favor.",
        "Jack": "Played Morgana convincingly as a potential Merlin candidate, and your demeanor plus late mission involvement pulled a lot of my Percival attention away from Diana at the worst possible time."

I could improve by being more vocal in shaping the narrative of who Merlin might be, as my late-game Merlin read felt more reactive than proactively constructed from earlier missions.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Played cautiously and tended to go with the emerging table consensus, which made her look fairly generic-good and kept her from standing out as Merlin. Her inclusion on multiple teams without pushing strong reads made her a safe-seeming pick for good leaders.",
        "Bob": "Blended in well as Mordred and took advantage of mission results without overclaiming credit, which helped maintain his cover. His willingness to sit back a bit made it harder for good to pin him as evil despite being on a crucial failing team.",
        "Charlie": "Came across as analytically minded but not domineering, often focusing on mission composition in a way that looked authentically good. Their reasoning was consistent, which made it easy for them to be trusted on several teams.",
        "Diana": "As Merlin, she did a solid job of not overcorrecting too hard against specific evil players, which kept her from being an obvious assassination target. However, some of her mission stances and subtle pushes on team choices hinted at hidden information once we looked back over the pattern.",
        "Eve": "As Oberon, she stayed extremely quiet/low-impact, which minimized the risk of accidental contradictions with coordinated evil narratives. Her low profile meant she neither drew heat nor gave away much useful associative information.",
        "Frank": "As Percival, he showed active interest in reading the special roles, but his signals about who he trusted were somewhat muddled, which helped evil. His early leadership didn\u2019t create a clear good spine, leaving room for ambiguity later.",
        "Henry": "Played like a straightforward good player, focusing on mission outcomes and voting patterns more than deep social reads. His teams and suspicions were generally reasonable but not forceful enough to anchor a strong good block.",
        "Iris": "As a leader on the critical Mission 4, she tried to construct a seemingly balanced, information-rich team, which backfired when evil was included. Her choices and explanations sounded sincere, which ironically helped the fail land more cleanly.",
        "Jack": "As Morgana, he provided strong, confident table presence that mimicked Merlin-like behavior and helped misdirect good. His assertiveness about team composition and reads was a useful smokescreen that contributed to confusion over the true Merlin."

I also didn\u2019t do enough proactive agenda-setting as a leader on Mission 3, relying too much on \u2018safe-feeling\u2019 players instead of constructing and testing sharper hypotheses. Next time I should more aggressively revisit assumptions after each mission and push clearer alternatives when forming teams.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Played a fairly low-key, cooperative good game, which made her easy to overlook and also easy to include on teams without much pushback. She didn\u2019t strongly force narratives, which helped her seem consistently safe but also meant her influence on team debates was more subtle than direct.",
        "Bob": "Very consistent and composed as Mordred, staying in the middle of the pack and rarely drawing extreme suspicion despite being on multiple critical teams. His style leaned on being \u2018reasonable\u2019 and blending with group consensus, which made his presence on failing missions look like bad luck rather than malice.",
        "Charlie": "Came across as analytically minded and generally tried to reason from mission results, which helped him read as good most of the time. His willingness to be on repeated teams without heavy self-defense made him look comfortable and trustworthy, which ironically helped evil hide around him.",
        "Diana": "As Merlin, she did a strong job of not over-signaling and kept her tone moderate, avoiding big hard pushes that would expose her. Her influence was felt more through soft steering and preference-indicating rather than loud accusations, which unfortunately wasn\u2019t enough to flip the outcome but was good role discipline.",
        "Eve": "Stayed very under the radar in terms of direct impact on mission team debates, which fit Oberon\u2019s hidden, disconnected evil role. Her low profile meant she neither attracted targeted scrutiny nor significantly disrupted good\u2019s reasoning, but she successfully avoided becoming a focal point.",
        "Frank": "As Percival, he tried to treat information cautiously and didn\u2019t over-assert a single hard read too early, which is good for protecting Merlin. However, his public signals about trust and doubt were mild enough that they didn\u2019t strongly crystallize a good bloc, so evil had room to maneuver.",
        "Grace": "As the Assassin, she played a convincingly flexible and pragmatic persona, which made her acceptable on teams and not obviously agenda-driven. She handled social pressure well and didn\u2019t panic around key missions, which helped maintain her cover and set up a strong endgame position.",
        "Iris": "Led Mission 1 and 4 in a way that felt sincerely logic-driven, which unintentionally gave some cover to evil when those teams went wrong because she didn\u2019t look like a saboteur. Her openness to reasoning and discussion made her seem like a cooperative good, but she may have trusted prior group narratives a bit too much.",
        "Jack": "As Morgana, he did a good job mirroring a \u2018Merlin-ish\u2019 calm confidence at times, which likely muddied the information Percival and others were inferring. His presence on the final failing mission without setting off alarm bells shows he maintained a reasonably trustworthy table image despite being evil."

However, I didn\u2019t narrow down the evil pool fast enough and let myself be too convinced by the consistent presence of Bob on teams that kept barely passing or barely failing. Next time I should push harder on structural logic (who was on which failed mission) and be more vocal about excluding repeat suspects from critical missions.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Played in a straightforward, low-drama way that made her seem reliably good, especially since both of her missions with mixed alignments (M3 and M4) failed without her looking like the clear cause. She seemed comfortable being placed on many teams and didn\u2019t over-defend herself, which is typically a good look for a good player.",
        "Bob": "Consistently inserted himself into mission teams and managed his votes in a way that made him look central and trustworthy, despite being on multiple failing missions (M3 and M4). His willingness to pass M2 as evil to build long-term credibility was very effective and made it harder to push him out later.",
        "Charlie": "Came across as quite clean, especially after being on a successful mission (M2) and then on failing missions where there were more obvious evil candidates. His playstyle seemed cooperative and not overly aggressive, which usually helps good players avoid suspicion.",
        "Diana": "Played a very controlled, measured game as Merlin, avoiding drawing too much attention while still ending up on good-looking teams. Her line on team compositions felt subtly guided toward good outcomes without loudly hard-clearing or hard-accusing people, which preserved her cover.",
        "Eve": "Stayed under the radar as Oberon, not strongly shaping team discussions or becoming a focal point of suspicion or trust. Her low profile meant she didn\u2019t really help coordinate evil publicly but also avoided giving good team strong alignment signals.",
        "Frank": "As Percival, he seemed to be actively trying to interpret Merlin/Morgana signals, but from my perspective his reads didn\u2019t strongly or clearly steer the table. He projected general caution but didn\u2019t lock in a firm good core early enough to stabilize team selection.",
        "Grace": "As Assassin, she took an early risk by failing Mission 1, which successfully sowed confusion among the initial trio. Later, she blended in well by participating in the clean Mission 2, which helped her maintain a plausible good image despite the suspicious start.",
        "Henry": "Felt like a genuinely good player who got unfortunately tied to the early fail on Mission 1, which tainted perceptions of him. His subsequent leadership on the failing Mission 3 didn\u2019t help his image, even though the fail likely came from elsewhere, making him look more suspicious than he deserved.",
        "Jack": "Played a subtle Morgana, only appearing on one failing mission (M4) late in the game, which limited the amount of hard data we had on him. His relatively low footprint in earlier missions made it easier for him to slip into the final critical team without triggering strong resistance."
