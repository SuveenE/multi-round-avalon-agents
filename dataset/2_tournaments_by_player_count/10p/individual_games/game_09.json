        "Frank": "As Merlin, stayed calm and understated, influencing team selection just enough to avoid fails while not appearing like the clearest info-holder, which successfully dodged my assassination.",
        "Grace": "As Mordred, pushed evil interests from the shadows, benefiting from being hard to clear or condemn since their impact was more in votes and nudges than loud table talk.",

        "Iris": "As Oberon, was relatively out of sync with coordinated evil play, which made them look more like a somewhat confused or independent good player than a known partner in evil.",
        "Jack": "As a late leader, picked a highly trusted, coherent team that passed, reinforcing the good team\u2019s narrative and helping lock in perceptions right before the assassination decision."
