Therefore, the optimal structure is always Diana + Iris + any three from {Alice, Bob, Frank, Jack}, with exactly one of those four being evil. Given table sentiment and the suspicion naturally falling more on Frank from the single-fail Mission 3, the highest-probability good subset is {Alice, Bob, Jack}, so I propose Alice, Bob, Jack, Diana, and myself (Iris), avoiding the most suspect member of that foursome while keeping the entire Mission 2 block hard-benched.",

I also didn\u2019t invest enough effort in subtly supporting the assassin\u2019s endgame reads on Merlin, so my information and behavior didn\u2019t help steer Frank toward Bob instead of Iris.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Tended to be consistently trusted and leveraged that to anchor multiple mission teams, suggesting she was good at sounding reasonable and aligning with visible success results. Her willingness to repeat similar team compositions later showed comfort in leaning on perceived cleared players.",
        "Bob": "Played a very controlled Merlin game, revealing just enough suspicion to get Mission 3 to fail while still avoiding looking like he had perfect info. His presence on late successful teams without attracting the assassination shows he balanced influence and subtlety well.",
        "Charlie": "Got dragged into the early heavy-fail Mission 2, yet managed not to become permanently tainted, indicating a calm table presence or convincing explanations. Seemed more reactive than driving team compositions later on.",
        "Diana": "Was repeatedly trusted on the late-game teams and used that position to stabilize good\u2019s path to victory. Her willingness to go back to the same team for Missions 4 and 5 shows she recognized and leaned into confirmed-safe patterns once they emerged.",
        "Eve": "As Mordred, participated in the big fail on Mission 2 but then stayed off later critical teams, which helped her avoid becoming an easy suspect. She seemed to accept a lower-profile role mid\u2013late game rather than aggressively forcing herself onto teams.",
        "Frank": "As assassin, he allowed a solid good core to form and then misread Merlin in the end, suggesting he was overly anchored on Iris\u2019s behavior. His leadership on Mission 1 created an early success that built his own credibility, but he didn\u2019t fully leverage that into controlling later team selections.",
        "Henry": "As Morgana, he engineered a Mission 3 fail with only one fail card, which was a good subtle evil play. However, the later team selections drifting away from him suggest he didn\u2019t fully convert that subtlety into long-term trust or control.",
        "Iris": "Her inclusion on Missions 4 and 5 and the resulting successes show she projected a trustworthy, steady-good vibe. Being assassinated incorrectly as Merlin indicates she looked insightful or central enough to be a plausible information role.",
        "Jack": "Repeated inclusion on Missions 3, 4, and 5 shows he built up a strong good image as the game progressed. He seemed comfortable re-running a successful team once it worked, helping lock in the final two mission successes."

      "self_assessment": "I created strong early suspicion around the Mission 2 team and helped secure that big triple-fail, but I didn\u2019t do enough later to muddy the Merlin reads or protect the Assassin from locking onto the wrong target. In future games, I should coordinate my visible behavior more carefully with Mordred and the Assassin to better mimic Merlin-like insights and create multiple plausible Merlin candidates.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Consistently ended up on key mission teams and maintained trust through both a fail and multiple successes, suggesting a calm, steady table presence that others were comfortable following.",
        "Bob": "Played Merlin subtly, guiding team selections toward safer compositions without drawing too much direct suspicion, especially by backing the successful late-game teams.",
        "Charlie": "Got pulled into the early failing team and then disappeared from later missions, suggesting either he wasn\u2019t strongly trusted or wasn\u2019t forceful in steering discussion afterward.",
        "Diana": "Came into prominence late, joining the critical Mission 4 and 5 success teams, indicating a conservative style that benefits from emerging consensus rather than driving it.",
        "Eve": "As Mordred, took on risky early involvement (triple-fail team) but then never appeared again, which likely helped reset perceptions and shed some of the suspicion from Mission 2.",
        "Frank": "As Assassin, took the bold early leader role on Mission 1 and then missed the Merlin call at the end, suggesting good social engagement but some difficulty parsing the subtle Merlin/percival divide.",
        "Grace": "As Oberon, joined the heavy-fail Mission 2 team and then vanished from later lineups, which probably heightened suspicion on that team but also left her with limited influence afterward.",
        "Iris": "Played quietly and solidly, ending up on the final two successful missions and soaking the Assassin shot, which means her table image was convincingly \u2018information-aware\u2019 without seeming too obvious.",
        "Jack": "Was trusted enough to lead and repeat the final successful team, indicating he projected a reliable, town-leaning presence and was effective at getting others to accept his team choices."

        "Alice": "You played a very steady, trustworthy game and ended up on all three successful missions, which reinforced your image as core good. Your willingness to repeat the successful Mission 3\u20135 block helped good stabilize around the correct team.",
        "Bob": "You balanced giving direction with not overexposing yourself as Merlin, especially by subtly converging on the safe Mission 4/5 team without making loud, flashy calls. Your reads on the evil-heavy Mission 2 and on keeping the final teams clean were clearly strong in hindsight.",
        "Charlie": "You looked quite suspicious after being on both Missions 1 and 2, especially given Mission 2\u2019s three fails, but you didn\u2019t overdefend yourself or panic. That lower-key reaction may have helped you avoid being hard-tunneled as evil despite the bad association.",
        "Diana": "You came into the game impactfully on Mission 4/5, and your acceptance of those teams projected a calm, good-aligned confidence. Your lack of strong resistance or chaotic re-teaming late made it easier for everyone to keep the final missions stable and successful.",
        "Eve": "Being on both the clean Mission 1 and the catastrophically failed Mission 2 made your alignment ambiguous, but the three-fail result eventually made that team look heavily evil. You blended into the early trust structure well, which is good evil play, but that big failure exposed your side later.",
        "Frank": "As leader of the successful first mission, you initially looked quite credible, which gave you some early social capital as assassin. However, that early success contrasted sharply with your side\u2019s later need for chaos, and in the end your Merlin read missed by landing on me instead of Bob.",
        "Grace": "Your Mission 2 leadership into a three-fail team created massive suspicion but also huge confusion, which is fitting for Oberon\u2019s disruptive role. The extremity of that mission result both advanced evil\u2019s short-term goals and ironically helped good later by clearly poisoning that team\u2019s associations.",
        "Henry": "You were on the disastrous Mission 2 and then led Mission 3 into a one-fail team, which kept you in a murky, high-suspicion zone for most of the game. As Morgana, you managed to stay relevant in team discussions, but the pattern of your mission results gave good enough data to start steering away from you.",
        "Jack": "You anchored the late game well as leader on Mission 5, confidently reusing the proven Mission 4 team and closing out the win. Your willingness to stick with that group rather than over-tinker with last-minute changes signaled strong good-aligned reasoning."

        "Bob": "Merlin reads were subtly expressed\u2014he steered away from evil-heavy configurations without loudly hard-clearing anyone, which made him look like a solid but not flashy voice and helped him dodge the assassin.",
        "Charlie": "Looked quite trustworthy early by being on the clean Mission 1, but his association with Eve and Grace in the disastrous Mission 2 hurt his credibility and made him seem more like a swing factor than an anchor.",
        "Diana": "Came across as quietly solid good, especially once she appeared in the clean Mission 4 and 5 lineups; she didn\u2019t over-argue, which actually made her approvals and doubts carry more weight.",
        "Eve": "As Mordred, blended well early with the successful Mission 1, then pivoted into heavy sabotage on Mission 2; her aggression there was impactful but maybe too blatant given the 3-fail outcome that exposed that team.",
        "Frank": "As Assassin, he used his early Mission 1 leadership to build initial trust, but later didn\u2019t fully capitalize on Merlin-hunting\u2014his final guess on Iris suggested he over-weighted her late-game calm and under-read Bob\u2019s subtle guidance.",
        "Grace": "As Oberon, her play felt somewhat disconnected and hard to read, which matched the hidden-evil role; being on the triple-fail team made her look bad, but her voting and table talk didn\u2019t strongly coordinate with other evils.",
        "Henry": "As Morgana, he was a central figure in the Mission 2 and 3 failures, mixing some persuasive logic with risky team choices; he generated just enough confusion to be plausible good for a while, but patterns around his mission compositions eventually looked suspicious.",
        "Iris": "Played a straightforwardly good-looking game, especially when she led Mission 4 with a clean team that we then repeated for Mission 5; her being chosen by the assassin shows she projected a confident, informed-good aura that was convincing enough to be mistaken for Merlin."
