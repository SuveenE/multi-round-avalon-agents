Mission 2\u2019s single fail with [Grace, Henry, Diana, Eve] tells us at least one of Grace/Diana/Eve/Henry is evil; since Henry is already highly suspect, we can reasonably keep Grace but should not include both Diana and Eve together. The broad table consensus has formed around a core of Charlie + Grace + Iris + Jack as the cleanest \"fresh blood\" plus anchor combination that has never produced a fail together. Adding Diana as the fifth lines up with multiple players\u2019 preferences (including Iris and Jack), keeps us to at most one person from each suspicious pool (M2 and M3), and gives a team composition that best balances statistical safety with social consensus: [Charlie, Grace, Iris, Jack, Diana].",

        "Eve": "Took advantage of the Mission 2 leadership to join and later lead critical missions, playing assertively enough to look proactive but not so much as to appear blatantly evil.",
        "Frank": "As a good player leading Mission 4, seemed to prioritize balancing prior mission history and social reads, but got misled into including at least one evil and couldn\u2019t fully disentangle the conflicting signals.",
        "Grace": "Got onto the first two missions and maintained a consistently trustworthy table presence, which was accurate but also made it hard to distinguish her from well-placed evil early on.",
        "Henry": "As Merlin, was subtly steering teams and reads without over-claiming info, but the good team (including me) didn\u2019t fully pick up on his hints and he couldn\u2019t prevent the key fails.",
        "Iris": "As Percival, tried to track and interpret the Merlin/Morgana signals, but their influence on final team choices didn\u2019t come through strongly enough to redirect the group away from stacked evil teams.",
        "Jack": "Played Morgana convincingly by blending in with reasonable suggestions and muddying the Merlin identity, contributing to the confusion around trustworthy voices in the mid and late game."
