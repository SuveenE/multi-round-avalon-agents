        "Bob": "Bob (Merlin) was cautious but quietly influential, nudging team choices in ways that often kept too many evil players off the same team while still avoiding looking too controlling.",
        "Charlie": "Charlie (Mordred) leaned into a more active leadership style, taking on a risky fail on Mission 2 that advanced evil\u2019s goals while still maintaining a semi-reasonable cover story afterward.",
        "Diana": "Diana (Assassin) was willing to allow double-fail pressure on Mission 3, which created big information swings and chaos but also risked tightening Merlin\u2019s reads, suggesting a bold, high-variance style.",
        "Frank": "Frank (Morgana) played in a way that made them a plausible Merlin candidate, adding ambiguity for Percival and supporting the evil team\u2019s information advantage.",
        "Grace": "Grace generally followed table consensus and appeared to prioritize mission stability over aggressive reads, which made her look reliably good but not especially loud in shaping the narrative.",
        "Henry": "Henry (Percival) clearly tried to track Merlin vs. a fake Merlin, showing sensitivity to subtle leadership and voting patterns, though the evil team\u2019s role distribution kept his information somewhat muddled.",
        "Iris": "Iris tended to be cautious with approvals and contributed as a more reactive voice, often weighing in after others rather than driving the primary arguments.",
        "Jack": "Jack\u2019s playstyle was more flexible and experimental with team compositions, occasionally pushing for mixes that tested alignments but sometimes unintentionally enabled evil-friendly lineups."

        "Henry": "As Percival, seemed to be balancing between protecting Merlin and not outing themselves, but the resulting caution led to less assertive steering of teams than might have been ideal.",

        "Frank": "As Morgana, he did a good job mimicking a careful, information-aware style that could plausibly be Merlin, which pulled my attention and muddied my Percival read; he made his suspicion and reasoning sound grounded even when pushing misdirections.",

        "Bob": "As Merlin, he played fairly cautiously, not hard-clearing or hard-accusing people, which kept him from being obvious but also may have left good a bit directionless. His team choice on Mission 1 was safe enough to pass but didn\u2019t clearly seed a strong good bloc for later.",
        "Charlie": "Played a very controlled, analytical style as Mordred, especially with the Mission 2 team that mixed good and evil in a believable way. He used the single fail there to sow doubt without overcommitting, keeping suspicion spread rather than focused on himself.",
        "Diana": "As Assassin, she leaned into the chaos on Mission 3 by allowing a double-fail that maximized confusion and gave cover to multiple evil roles. Her table presence seemed reasonably calm, which helped make that high-fail mission look like a \u2018mixed mistakes\u2019 situation rather than coordinated evil.",
