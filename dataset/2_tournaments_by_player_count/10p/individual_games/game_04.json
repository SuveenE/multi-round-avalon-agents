Next time, I need to communicate my Merlin read more assertively while still keeping it subtle enough to avoid overexposing them.",
      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Very careful and low-key as Merlin, giving gentle nudges instead of hard directives, which made it harder for evil to pin her down but also left good a bit directionless at key votes. Her mission vote patterns were consistently pro-good, but the lack of strong table-steering made it easier for evil narratives to take over.",
        "Bob": "Played like a solid, straightforward good player: generally trusting, not overtalking, and not trying too hard to solve publicly. This made him appear reliably good but also meant he didn't strongly challenge suspicious team compositions.",
        "Charlie": "Came off as generally trustworthy and measured, with reasonable logic on missions he was involved in. However, he seemed a bit too willing to repeat others\u2019 reasoning instead of pushing his own, which let evil slip through some votes.",
        "Diana": "As Assassin, she stayed nicely under the radar, neither too quiet nor too loud, and avoided drawing direct suspicion even when on the failing mission 3 team. Her demeanor blended well with the table, which made it hard for good to confidently flag her as endgame dangerous.",
        "Frank": "Voted in a way that largely aligned with good interests early, which helped build him a pretty clean image. He didn\u2019t push very aggressive theories, which made him feel honest but also a bit passive in challenging evil-aligned team proposals.",
        "Grace": "As Mordred, she leveraged her clean early mission 1 success to build a lot of trust and used that to sneak into later suspect teams. She was comfortable taking leadership and proposing teams that looked just plausible enough to pass without heavy resistance.",
        "Henry": "As Oberon, his play felt a bit chaotic and less coordinated, which actually made him hard to read\u2014some of his moves looked like confused good rather than deliberate evil. Being on the final failing mission while not obviously orchestrating things helped him avoid being the prime suspect.",
        "Iris": "As Morgana, she did a good job mirroring Merlin-ish behavior, especially in how she spoke with confidence and offered structured reasoning on team selections. Her assertive style likely drew some of my own early Percival trust, muddying my Merlin read.",
        "Jack": "As a good player, he seemed fairly rational in discussion and willing to rethink his positions, but his final mission 4 team composition ended up being too trusting of hidden evil. His leadership moment was decisive for the game, and evil exploited the gaps in his reads well."

      "player_observations": {
        "Alice": "Played a very subtle Merlin, not overpushing suspicions but consistently aligning with good-leaning teams early. Her low-key style made it harder for evil to pinpoint her, but also made it harder for me to clearly read and follow her signals.",
        "Bob": "Quiet, low-impact presence that made him seem generically good but also easy to overlook in team discussions. His lack of strong pushes meant he was never really under pressure, which was good for good, but didn\u2019t strongly help us crack the evil team.",
        "Charlie": "Came off as fairly trustworthy by being on Mission 1\u2019s success and not overreacting after Mission 2 failed. He didn\u2019t strongly drive the table\u2019s logic, but he also didn\u2019t introduce much confusion, making him look like a stable, low-drama good player.",
        "Diana": "Blended in well as evil by not being the loudest or most extreme voice, which kept suspicion distributed elsewhere. She leveraged the chaos from multiple failing teams rather than needing to manufacture it herself.",
        "Eve": "As Percival, she seemed to hedge between Merlin candidates, which may have muted her effectiveness in steering teams. Her signals weren\u2019t strong enough to clearly differentiate Alice from Iris, which let Morgana stay plausible longer than was safe.",
        "Grace": "Being on the first two teams gave her a lot of early credibility, and she used it well to stay central to team discussions. She maintained a convincing good persona even after a fail on her team, which kept me and others from locking onto her as Mordred.",
        "Henry": "Played a chaotic, somewhat opaque game that fit Oberon well, sowing doubt without clearly coordinating. His inclusion on the final failing team shows how he stayed just plausible enough to slip through despite accumulating suspicion.",
        "Iris": "Sold the Morgana role strongly by mirroring some Merlin-like behavior and staying active in reasoning about teams. Her presence on a failing mission didn\u2019t immediately condemn her because her talk tracked \u2018good logic\u2019 enough to keep good players second-guessing.",
        "Jack": "As a good player leading the final mission, he was in a tough spot and seemed to rely too much on prior table narratives rather than fully re-evaluating the fail pattern. His team choice showed some trust in previously questionable players, which evil capitalized on."
