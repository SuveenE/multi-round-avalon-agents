          "game_result": "lost",
          "self_assessment": "I played consistently pro-mission and helped establish early trust on Mission 1, but I didn\u2019t push hard enough to dissect vote patterns and mission team compositions after the first fail. I should have been more vocal about locking in likely goods, challenging the inclusion of repeat suspicious players, and coordinating more clearly with people who seemed like they might be Merlin or Percival.",
          "player_observations": {
            "Bob": "You were subtly directive, often nudging team choices without over-explaining, which fits a careful Merlin style, though it was hard to distinguish you from an informed evil or a confident good early on. Your quiet consistency on team logic in later missions, especially around excluding certain people, should have been a stronger signal to me.",
            "Charlie": "You played a very believable, middle-of-the-pack good, blending in by supporting reasonable teams while slipping onto a critical failing mission without drawing big suspicion. Your willingness to be on the larger Mission 2 team and then not over-defend yourself afterward was an effective low-heat evil strategy.",
            "Diana": "You leaned into a confident, analytical persona that made your presence on Mission 3 feel initially reasonable, even when it turned out to be disastrous with two fails. The way you framed suspicions on others instead of addressing the implications of that mission outcome was a strong assassin-style misdirection that I should\u2019ve challenged more.",
            "Eve": "Your play felt somewhat disconnected from the emerging table consensus, which in hindsight fits Oberon\u2019s information disadvantage\u2014sometimes your team proposals and pushes felt slightly off without being blatantly evil. Leading the final failing mission while not seeming like the central strategist for evil was an effective way to fly under the radar.",
            "Frank": "You projected a very Merlin-like or strong-information-good vibe, confidently steering suspicion and speaking with authority about who was likely clean or dirty. That resemblance to a power good role made it very hard to read you correctly and likely helped mislead us away from the real Merlin.",
            "Grace": "You came across as straightforwardly good, especially from the early successful mission, but didn\u2019t strongly impose your views on later team compositions. Your relatively low-aggression, cooperative play made you seem trustworthy, though I wish we had more strongly consolidated around you as a confirmed-lean-good later.",
            "Henry": "You seemed to be trying to track information carefully and sometimes reacted strongly to small shifts in team composition, which in hindsight fits Percival trying to interpret signals from suspected Merlin/Morgana. Your reads didn\u2019t gain as much traction as they could have, and I should have paid closer attention when your instincts diverged from the popular narrative.",
            "Iris": "You played a quieter, more reactive good, tending to follow arguments rather than initiate them, which made it harder to form a clear read on you but also kept you from being heavily targeted by suspicion. Your voting pattern felt mostly consistent with good, but I didn\u2019t work with you enough to build a strong mutual trust.",
            "Jack": "You appeared flexible and willing to go along with reasonable-sounding proposals, which made you seem like a cooperative good rather than someone pushing a hidden agenda. Because you didn\u2019t anchor big accusations or hard defenses, your alignment stayed a bit blurry, and I didn\u2019t leverage your perspective as much as I could have."

          "self_assessment": "As Oberon, I stayed low-key enough that I didn\u2019t draw much heat, which helped evil avoid being cleanly solved, especially around the chaos of Missions 2 and 3. I could have done a better job subtly influencing team compositions and discussion tempo so that my presence more actively misdirected good rather than just blending into the background.",
          "player_observations": {
            "Bob": "Played aggressively and leaned into high-impact mission choices, which fit an assassin trying to stay relevant in late-game reads. His involvement on the double-fail Mission 3 created good WIFOM and made it hard to cleanly clear or condemn him.",
            "Charlie": "Came across as straightforward and somewhat trusting, especially early, which made them a natural candidate for inclusion on teams. Their generally honest table presence helped evil slip into teams without too much resistance.",
            "Diana": "Tried to reason things out systematically and pushed for \u2018sensible\u2019 team constructions, which signaled a good-aligned mindset but also made her vulnerable to being subtly steered. Her leadership on Mission 2 showed she was willing to compromise to keep consensus, which evil could exploit.",
            "Eve": "Played a strong, proactive evil game by getting on key missions and using the Mordred information edge to pressure good. Her participation in the failed missions helped frame suspicion in multiple directions rather than squarely on herself.",
            "Frank": "Approached the game with a logical tone but seemed a bit cautious, especially in leadership situations. His Mission 4 team showed he was trying to assemble a \u2018clean\u2019 group, but that caution came too late to undo earlier damage.",
            "Grace": "Came off as very naturally good and was often treated as a stable core pick early, which ironically helped evil hide among the people orbiting her. She didn\u2019t push super hard on alternative narratives, which let some suspicious patterns persist.",
            "Henry": "Played like a careful information-holder, trying not to overextend, which fit Merlin but also meant some of his soft clears and pushes were easy to muddy. His reluctance to go all-in on certain accusations gave evil room to survive deeper into the game.",
            "Iris": "Seemed actively engaged in reading table dynamics and was quick to track who was defending whom, consistent with a Percival trying to protect possible Merlins. However, her protective instincts didn\u2019t fully lock onto the right signals, which left Henry less shielded than ideal.",
            "Jack": "Adopted a confident, occasionally misleading tone that worked well for Morgana, sending mixed signals to Percival and complicating Merlin\u2019s cover. His presence in discussions created plausible \u2018wise good\u2019 energy that helped divert attention from the true information sources."

          "self_assessment": "I correctly trusted the initial Mission 1 team and stayed reasonably open-minded, but I didn\u2019t adjust strongly enough after Mission 2 failed under my leadership. I need to be more aggressive about excluding overlapping suspects from subsequent teams and paying closer attention to vote patterns and who quietly benefits from each mission result.",
          "player_observations": {
            "Bob": "Played a very controlled, low-key Merlin game, avoiding big pushes and instead gently steering teams, which made him hard to read as special but also harder for good to follow confidently.",
            "Charlie": "Seemed genuinely confused at key points, which made them look honest but also a bit passive; they didn\u2019t strongly drive alternative team proposals when there was evidence to pivot.",
            "Diana": "Stayed very under-the-radar as Oberon, not drawing much attention to themselves at all; their presence didn\u2019t factor heavily into most team discussions, which ultimately helped evil stay hidden.",
            "Eve": "As Assassin, maintained a solid, composed table presence, rarely overreaching; they let others argue and subtly backed lines of reasoning that pointed suspicion away from the actual Merlin.",
            "Frank": "As Percival, tried to protect Merlin by not over-clearing anyone too loudly, but that restraint also meant town didn\u2019t get as much benefit from his extra information as it could have.",
            "Grace": "Played like a straightforward good player\u2014open and talkative\u2014but occasionally accepted risky team compositions without pushing hard to resolve contradictions from earlier missions.",
            "Henry": "Mordred played a very persuasive, central role in team-building, confidently inserting himself onto multiple teams and using the partial successes and failures to muddy reads rather than draw clean conclusions.",
            "Iris": "As Morgana, did a good job mirroring the tone of a thoughtful good player, chiming in with plausible logic and avoiding obviously opportunistic votes, which made her blend in well with the village.",
            "Jack": "Looked very trustworthy early due to the clean Mission 1, and then leaned on that credit for later discussions; he didn\u2019t pivot hard enough once later missions failed, which unintentionally helped evil hide among the more active talkers."

I also failed to clearly champion consistently good-leaning players like Bob and Jack early, which made it harder for good to converge on safe teams without exposing myself as Merlin.",

            "Diana": "Stayed relatively under the radar as assassin, not drawing much suspicion and letting others (especially Grace and Iris) take the spotlight in mission shaping and social dynamics.",
            "Eve": "As Percival, seemed uncertain about distinguishing Merlin from Morgana and didn\u2019t strongly anchor onto a single candidate, which reduced the protective effect Percival can offer.",
            "Frank": "Looked solidly good and was trusted early, but after Mission 2\u2019s fail didn\u2019t push hard to dissect who was likely responsible, leaving the narrative space open for evil to exploit.",
            "Grace": "As Mordred, projected a confident, central leadership style, especially early, and used that to get onto critical teams while maintaining a plausible good persona after the first success.",

            "Jack": "Showed strong good instincts and was willing to question suspect teams, but joined the final failed mission, suggesting he either overtrusted others\u2019 reads or was swayed late in discussion."

            "Grace": "You played Mordred in a way that blended in with good discussion, especially around the failed Mission 2 where suspicion didn\u2019t lock firmly onto you. Your ability to participate constructively without overreaching kept your name from becoming a consensus evil target.",
            "Henry": "As Percival, you did a decent job of treating both Charlie and Bob as plausible information sources without making it obvious whom you trusted more. At times, it felt like you could have been more forceful in steering teams once you formed a stronger Merlin read.",
