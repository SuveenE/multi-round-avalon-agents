Mission 2\u2019s single fail with [Grace, Henry, Diana, Eve] tells us at least one of Grace/Diana/Eve/Henry is evil; since Henry is already highly suspect, we can reasonably keep Grace but should not include both Diana and Eve together. The broad table consensus has formed around a core of Charlie + Grace + Iris + Jack as the cleanest \"fresh blood\" plus anchor combination that has never produced a fail together. Adding Diana as the fifth lines up with multiple players\u2019 preferences (including Iris and Jack), keeps us to at most one person from each suspicious pool (M2 and M3), and gives a team composition that best balances statistical safety with social consensus: [Charlie, Grace, Iris, Jack, Diana].",

I know I\u2019m good, so from my perspective the M2-evil pool is {Alice, Henry, Charlie} and the M3-evil pool is {Frank, Bob, Iris, Jack}.

Then I add both Eve and Diana\u2014our two fully untested players\u2014so we don\u2019t double-dip further into either fail set.

If Charlie is evil, then the Mission 3 core {Bob, Frank, Grace, Henry} is fully good. That makes the strongest structural line to hard-dodge the entire Mission 2 team (Alice, Charlie, Diana, Eve) and build around the Mission 3 core plus a fresh fifth. Among the non-M2, non-M3 players, Jack has been aligned with the table\u2019s most consistent structural logic (hard-dodging M2, not re-running the full M3/4 block blindly), while Iris is the only one pushing to re-include Charlie, which looks worse if Charlie is indeed the M4 saboteur.
